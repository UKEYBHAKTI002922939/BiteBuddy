Hard Rock Cafe,5,"food taste great, good prices"
Papa John's Pizza,4,"its a nice cafe, and the food was delicious. the price was crazy high, even for the south end. a small breakfast sandwich with swapping bacon for avocado was almost 11. service was pretty slow, and they messed up an order ahead of me in multiple ways. might have just been a bad day, but overall i docked a couple stars for price and service."

Hot Eastern,1,"i bring customers to pastoral for lunch a decent amount. the reason i gave 4 stars is simply because the menu is kind of limited. its definitely a good size for a lunch menu, and maybe its just me and my customers, but it ends up being we either get a pizza or one or two of the same sandwiches over and over. service is always attentive, they have a great drink selection, and were always happy with the food we get!"

Terra at Eataly Boston,4,"we swung by for a quick lunch today and had a terrible experience overall. that the service in general was pathetic would be an understatement. we never got an app we ordered, were made to wait a long time for our swiches and worst of all, my wife, who happens to be vegetarian, found a piece of bacon in her side of sweet potato fries. that last one is just plain unacceptable for a restaurant in a hotel like this. this was by far the worst experience we have had at a luxury collection property having stayed and dined at multiple ones all over the world. we are definitely not going back here which is quite a shame because we really used to like it."

Dunkin',5,love it my favorite dominican restaurant
Abe & Louie's,5,"translated by google its food is exquisite, its staff very friendly, it has good prices, food is always at a good temperature.i did not give it 5 stars, because i have experience as a shef, and i recommended to the administrator that when the person in charge of cutting the cooked meat sharpens the knives, clean them well, because metal particles remain on the edge from the knife which when the meat is cut again they remain in it and who consumes them?well, the client.originalsu comida es exquisita,  su personal muy amable, tiene buenos precios, siempre a buena temperatura los alimentos.no le di 5 estrellas, porque tengo experiencia como shef, y recomende al administrador que cuando el encargado de cortar la carne cocida le ponga filo a los cuchillos limpie bien los mismos,  pues en el filo quedan particulas de metal del cuchillo las cuales al volver a cortar la carne quedan en ella y quien las consume?pues el cliente."

Sonic Drive-In,5,"came here with a kid and we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time. one of the employees saw us walking in and went straight to the register. being the first time here, we took a long time to decide what to order. the employee was very patient with us. as we waited for the food, more and more ppl came in. this was a sat evening.when i went up to get my food, it was missing one french fries order. the guy who made the food saw me standing there as i was waiting for him. i told him what i was missing and he kindly made for me. i head back to my table. when the order was ready, he didnt call for me but hand deliver ed it to me at the table.food, i have to say is quite expensive here but its good. seasoning for the sweet potato fries are good. milkshakes are thick and creamy. the kid likes her vanilla milkshake so thats good to know. i ordered an oreo milkshake and it had lots of oreos in it."
Ginger Exchange - Symphony Boston,5,"translated by google the food is balanced between the main food groups that are good for health, beautifully presented, served quickly, but the taste is not stable, the same dish is sometimes delicious, sometimes slightly salty.originalthc n ch bin cn i gia cac nhom thc n chinh tt cho sc khoe,trinh bay ep mt, phuc vu nhanh chong ,nhng vi thi cha n inh, cng mt mon n co luc thi thi va ming rt ngon,co luc thi hi mn ."

Temptations Cafe,3,"hookah is supposed to be social and relaxing. this place is neither. i regret ever going in this place and even more so knowing i spent 120 for two drinks, two hummus plates and one hookah. everything is overpriced, and the music is too loud to talk even to the person next to you. did i mention the giant tvs everywhere? what a nightmare."

Dumpling Palace,5,"great atmosphere, conveniently close to fenway park. awesome outdoor area!"
Villa Mexico Cafe,5,high prices.. good taste.. in center of city.. nice location..
Vito's Tavern,5,"i came here expecting some really fantastic milkshakes with a side of burger. it was more the other way around. we got seated quickly despite there being a wait, were served promptly, although our waitress didnt really do anything other than the bare minimum of her job and seemed somewhat cranky. we ordered burgers and shakes, and were quite excited to see the shakes arrive. they look fantastic, but upon tasting them... they were less than mediocre. all the extra pizzazz doesnt really make up for the sheer lack of flavor and somewhat watery texture they had. im used to thick, rich and creamy shakes these were less enjoyable than most fast food shakes. disappointing.however, my burger arrived and i was quite pleased. the chips were hard as a rock and unappetizing, but the burger was well cooked and juicy. my only qualm is that it didnt hold together. bun needed better toasting, maybe. i had a fried egg on mine, too, so it fell apart especially badly! most places will do a hard fry on their eggs mine was over easy, as i like it, but exploded a lot more than i expected. even though i was so covered in egg yolk and cheese i had to go wash my hands after, it was awesome.all in all, the shakes suck and the burgers are awesome."
Noon,5,disappointingly small popovers maybe 2 diameter? after hearing so much about them... being in a pool of honey flavored sauce seemed an odd combo too.  maybe it was just a bad idea to try eating at the bar late at night.  the fried clams were overly oily too.. like the fryer wasnt hot enough.none of it party thought the visit was worth repeating unfortunately 
Swish Shabu,1,terrible service.  okay food.
Saltie Girl,5,great place the steak is very tender. you must check it out.

La Tapatia Taqueria,5,"gourmet dumpling house is one of my favorite restaurants in chinatown. they are notoriously busy. theyre not one of the top restaurants in boston for nothing. unfortunately if you dine here as a couple you will be sharing a table with strangers which will be the only unpleasant thing about your dining experience. we came right as they opened their doors so half of the restaurant was empty but they still seated my party of two at a larger table and had us share it with another couple. as long as you only care about the food, its a solid 55.i first visited this establishment 3 years ago and thought it was good but nothing special. i made my second visit approximately 1 month ago and basically loved everything we ordered. i have a tendency to overorder but with gourmet having such a large menu, its hard not to. their soup dumplings are plump and full of delicious, flavorful soup. the szechuan wonton with chili oil was a refreshing dish due to the cucumber and carrots that accompanied the wontons. the chili oil is a tasty mixture, however, it is lacking in heat. the wontons were solid. the sandong style pan fried dumplings with pork  shrimp were good but i would have liked them more if they were even crispier. each of our dumpling dishes came with their own dipping sauce. you will have to ask for chili sauce because they dont keep any condiments at the table.the scallion pancakes were perfect! crispy and delicious. my boyfriend and i are going through a phase where we are obsessed with salt  pepper chicken wings and calamari so we had to order them. everything was seasoned well and fried to perfection. both the chicken wings and calamari sit on a bed of iceberg lettuce to add a different texture and balance out the saltiness. i love that the chicken wings were also seasoned with that special chinese seasoning on top of the salt  pepper that really just enhances the whole dish. we definitely had to get a few togo boxes but our overall lunch experience was super yummy!"

The Glenville Stops,5,good environment compare to other restaurants in chinatown
Arya Trattoria,5,"after wanting to try this for a while, we were very disappointed. we did takeout, which was good since the restaurant doesnt seem to be abiding by the covid 25 capacity restrictions inside and was completely full including large groups and the bar. while the ropa vieja and sweet plantains were delicious, the ceviche didnt have enough acid, the octopus was like rubber, and the shrimp gambas tasted offfishy and didnt have enough spice. the food might be better in the restaurant, but with their covid noncompliances, we will not be going back anytime soon."

QDOBA Mexican Eats,5,"weve consistently gotten incorrect food when ordering rapid take out.  each time, theyve shown no remorse for making us drive all of the way back.  theyve remade the food when specifically requested, but offered nothing for our trouble or inconvenience.  most recently, i had to clearly drive all the way back in the blizzard, and i barely got a mumbled sorry when they handed me the corrected item."

Jersey Mike's Subs,2,"dumpling cafe is rather spacious compared to some of the other chinatown dumpling houses youll visit, however, its still a tight squeeze!overall, i thought the food was really good, though, not the best ive had in bostons chinatown. that being said, the bigger inconvenience was the lack of reservation that i had made earlier that same day. with a group of 6 people, this meant waiting when i didnt expect, nor plan to.overall, still a great experience, with better than average food at fantastic prices."
Bertucci's Italian Restaurant,4,"overpriced  but enjoy the crowd, and people watch potentially a celebrity, or famous athlete  its a known bruinsceltics hangout while sitting outside near christopher columbus waterfront park  harborwalk. servers  waitstaff are attractive but lackadaisical, borderline indolent. highlights boneless buffalo wings."

Ostra,5,great fresh bagels
Cafe Quattro,3,welcoming and short line.
Wingz & Tingz,4,nothing seemed fresh.  the takoyaki was deep fried for some reason. the only good part of the ramen was the corn kernals. the hunan noodles broth was bland.  the appetizer came out 5 minutes after the entreee.  we decided to come here since the line for ramen up the street was so long.  bad choice

Frontera Grill,5,"good food, though even when you ask for spicy, its not that spicy. they dont serve on traditional dishes with the injera on the bottom of the plate. portions are also slightly smaller than im used to, and prices are a bit high. but for convenience and decent tasting food its great, and i love easy access ethiopian."

Andre's Cafe,5,this location is ok in terms of speed and accuracy.  they make mistakes but not all the time.  they arent super slow or super fast.  i havent had any issues with cleanliness either.  today we got big macs ordered special and they made it correctly.  no complaints here.   edit let me correct this. they did make a mistake smh. should have known my husbands big mac had no big mac sauce. like really?!!? so i had to turn around. park the car i originally went to the drive through for a reason hello and get a new sandwich...upon taking it out of the bag it was all disheveled.  gotta live mcdonalds. smh

Tsurutontan Udon Noodle Brasserie Boston,3,"i came here without knowing what to expect, and boy was i pleasantly surprised! the food was presented very beautifully and, most importantly, tasted amazing! the scallop was cooked perfectly, and the broccolicauliflower on the side were so nice. the orata fish had such good flavor and was perfectly cooked. the artichoke heart with fennel and grape fruit was a great combination of flavors. i loved how the space felt, even though it was a little tight. service was great and attentive. i will definitely come back!"

Cafe Artigiano,5,good airport option
Brown Sugar Cafe,5,excellent venezuelan arepas!
Joe's On Newbury,5,"thia place is amazing! if youre thinking of going... do it! the burgers are amazing, cooked to perfection with endless combinations of toppings. they have a big papi burger and another burger that was created by a child from his charity and a portion of the sales of that burger go to the charity which i think is hella cool. this place was great for us because we just wanted a burger because we were really super hungry but we also love to try new foods. after going in and checking out the menu we couldnt decide which one we wanted! so now we plan on going back on date night as much as possible so we can try them all out. we dont drink so i cant speak for those, but i can tell you about the gourmet frappes they have... theyre towering... huge with full size desserts on top.   this place exceeded all expectations. its a little small in there, but ive seen worse not a negative, just a heads up for anyone reading this review."

Stelio's Family Restaurant,1,had a great time with my lil guy!
Krasi,5,i had the pork belly with quinoa it was good.  the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  price is hmm..a little bit over but i guess its because of the area.
Tremont House of Pizza,5,depending on what your order is. the food is ok i guess.. my problem is the woman who takes the order over the phone for delivery  never seems to listen to you or understand english.. she dont seem to realize that people want thier food correct in order to enjoy it..she offers no makeup for messing up your orders..the last thing my wife and i ordered just last night was two identical chicken parm subs with simply extra sauce on both..we stressed it..she forgets or didnt listen and we get two extremely dry subs. call her back all she says is i didnt charger you for extra sauce..get an attitude about her messup.. and hang up..i did like some of the food but i am not impressed by customer service and will never come back here..and my family was a good customer who live nearby..i will let others know not to eat here..
Nino's Pizza,1,unjustifiably high prices  single tacos for 5 and less than a cob worth of elote that was average at best for 8?  quality of the food was decent but certainly not worth schlepping here if you dont live nearby.  nothing wrong with service  probably would have been a better experience had this spot not been hyped up by my friends.

Bailey & Sage,5,"as a malaysian, i think i qualify to write this comment haha! in general, they serve pretty good options and dishes. the portion was huge for a very reasonable price in boston. i return to this restaurant so so many times that i have lost count. its a really good fix to my cravings and the staff were really friendly too.but my true malaysian blood asked that i critic on its authenticity too. ive tried many different dishes here, and i can tell you whats goodnot based on a malaysian taste bud.roti canai was ok, crispy and soft. milk in curry was a little on the stronger end and it didnt bring out the true mamak style roti canai. if you are craving for roti canai, go for it. but if you can make curry at home, i suggest you make your own. but obviously, this can vary based on your personal preferences.nasi lemak was so gooooood. but again the curry chicken wasnt my favorite. this can vary based on your personal preferences.hainanese chicken rice was pretty good too! its a yes!i would not recommend prawn mee. the soup base wasnt thick enough and tasted like salt water.our favorite kangkung belacan? yes! please order this and its so good to have another bowl of rice!i tried the seafood scramble egg chow fun the guong fu chao  too. id say its pretty amazing! they serve you with lots of gravy and seafood. i love it!salty fish fried rice? yums.what about beverage and desserts? i tried the malaysian coffee, its not the true char chan teng  style, but its better than the latte you ordered from a chain coffee shop. sweet and milky. its a good craving fix!and for our favorite abc ais kacang? try it! they were a little heavy on the syrup part, but thats just because i prefer it less sweet. i finished the whole bowl myself, so you know its really good."

Denny's,5,"food is pretty good, nothing special. skip the stinky tofu!"
Cappy's Pizza & Subs,4,"the service was very fast and friendly, and i thought the prices were fine considering the location and the amount of food you get. its great to have an indian option in faneuil hall, and u was looking forward to trying it. unfortunately i thought the food was very bland and watery. i got a combo plate with chicken vindaloo and saag paneer and both were disappointing and really missing the flavor i was hoping for. the vindaloo, though they warned me it was spicy, was not spicy at all to me.  i didnt try the naan but it didnt look tempting from what i could see.  a bit disappointing overall."
Clover Food Lab,5,"stopped in on halloween night and had a great time. my kind of bar..live music whoever played that night was crazy fun, and another side of the bar to escape to and hang out..less crowded. drinks were decent, not the best craft selection but not the worst."

"Happy Lamb Hot Pot, Boston 快乐小羊",3,"the original location in east boston makes one of the best italian style pizzas in the area.  i judge pizza based on how a place makes a simple cheese pizza and they do a great job.  thin, crispy crust with very flavorful sauce and cheese.  the sauce is not bland or too sweet as in some restaurants and they seem to use something like parmesan or romano to kick up the cheese flavor, not just mozzarella.  all in all, this is close to perfection.  the restaurant only sells pizza and grilled meat steak tips, lamb tips, sausage. sometimes chicken tips.  there are no salads, appetizers or desserts, but it is well worth the visit."
Oisa Ramen,3,good authentic mexican food!!
Compari's Banquet Facility,5,this is a great place to stop by for breakfast or lunch. service is good and ive never had a bad crepe here. there are enough dessertvegetarian options. its a very cute cafe and worth stopping by.

LoLa Burger Boston,4,incredibly executed dishes
Chuck E. Cheese,5,hands down some of the best pizza ive ever had!

Chef Chang's,5,best size in slices
Tenoch Mexican,5,"great place for seafood. get the duck breast and the eggplant when you go. dont think twice. drink choices and decour are good, service was good too. i would only state that getting a table is preferable and limited. if you get a bench, its a bit cramped. but overall really liked whaling in ok and would go back again !"

Pete's Dockside,2,"the rude 3rd floor doorman demanded my wife and i obtain hand stamps on the 1st floor to enter the deck area. a fairly difficult task given that i held 2 1 year olds in my arms. while we debated with him, advising that no stamp was offered when we entered the restaurant, 7 people of various ages ranging from early 20s to 60s approx stepped onto the deck without having their hands looked at or questioned. we were not granted entry to the deck, which had ample room, because of our children, even though the hostess confirmed earlier in the day that highchairs were available outside. a call to the manager minutes later granted me a lazy apology and invitation back to be taken care of. my family and i chose not to further waste our time. i suggest you dont either."

Exodus Bagels,3,"if your idea of a great restaurant is dictate by the creativity of the menu, parla is hands down the best place in boston that ive experienced. between the ddinspired random cocktail generator or the level up drink quests  it rewards the curiosity of the openminded imbiber. for those who dont want to roll the dice literally or figuratively, the predefined drinks are well balanced and can be  customized to your tastes with bespoke shrubs and uncommon ingredientspreparations.the place is small, so not a great place for large groups. i have a limited perspective on the food as i stuck to the small plates menu patatas bravas, beef meatball, ricotta fritters and calamari. the food was simple, satisfying and unpretentious. looking forward to a return trip to sample the entrees."

BLR by Shojo,4,great fresh tasty food. nice decor. nice staff owner is nice to customers rude to his employees. he so caught up in his anger he doesnt know customers are watching i have eaten here 3 times. 2 out of 3 i have witnessed the owneri think he is the owner acts like it being very rude to employees who are learning as they go. if you go during lunch call order in. long lines only one register. today i called my order in. went in long line. so i stand in line then notice across the room people are picking up orders. i was wrong. got back in long line. a few minutes later an employee asked if i ordered motioned for me to come to the bar. the owner and a lady was messing with a register. the employee said excuse me but can i use the register to cash this customer out. the owner started yelling some broken english. the employee explained that i already ordered and my food was ready andi just needed to pay. owner says very firmly fine use it! gave the employee a look that could kill. no regards to me standing there. place is great with alot of potential just needs another register and more organization and owner not sure if he is owner white hair guy needs to learn how to maintain his cool. hope they extend their hours to 11pm.
PITA Restaurant,4,best brazilian around!
Johnson's Restaurant and Dairy Bar,5,the food was great but the service was not. the waiter was not the most pleasant and the restaurant imposes a ridiculous service fee. i think this guaranteed fee encourages the waiters to be unpleasant because regardless of their service they are rewarded.

Jacob Wirth Restaurant,4,"what a fantastic meal. this place is fantastic. i went in a little skeptical. although i love toro, i am not a huge pizzameat person. that said i had some amazing food here. i loved the risotto, the anchovies, and all the vegetables the brussel sprouts, the broccoli rabe and cauliflower. yum. i love that this place is small plates and they offer small portions of pasta. i love to try lots of different things. i recently came back for amazing pizza, get the pepe bianco and for brunch, i have never had a better breakfast sandwich! the restaurant has a great comforting atmosphere and awesome staff!!!"
7 Nana Japanese Steakhouse,5,open 24 hours and the food is great.
Blue Mountain,4,love the blue cheese sauce
Buffalo Wild Wings,4,"i heard good things so my family and i went. not impressed. the crabmeat roll was entirely flavorless, the salmon was a little dry, the stuffed shrimp casserole was incredibly overcooked and rubbery. definitely not worth the cost, not with so many other seafood places nearby. the only redeeming qualities were the very friendly waitress and the clam chowder."
Woody's Pizza,5,"food and service is pretty good. the main entree are mostly cooked cantonese style, and appetizers like beef teriyaki are much like what youll find in takeout. i would recommend the ginger scallion lobster and steamed oyster. theyre by market price"
Atha's Famous Roast Beef,4,"some dishes still have food particles on them, not very clean,  decor is old and yellowship."

Pho Viet’s,5,"my wife and i went there for dinner the other night and it was wonderful.  the service was very good and the food was prepared perfectly and came out hot.  we had an appetizer, main course with dessert and coffee all of which were delicious.  the prices are a little high but i feel that you get what you pay for.  we would recommend this place to others looking for a nice dining experience."
The Red Hat,2,"i wouldnt even give this place one star, if that was an option. but since i have to, ill just say that its for the look of the place. i have been wanting to try this place for awhile and was excited to finally try it out. what a mistake. my boyfriend and i ordered two burgers, a shareable fries, and two big moo shakes for 33. the burgers were mediocre at best. almost 9 for a thin burger with no flavor? and no side included? thats a joke. then we move onto the fries. the shareable was the size of what would normally come with your burger at a formal restaurant. and we paid 4 for these? not to mention the best part, they were shriveled up and over fried as if they had been fried hours before and then refried to be served to us. then we come to the big moo shakes. which are supposed to be a large. they should be considered a medium. and we paid 5 each these. i got mint chocolate chip. not minty at all. my boyfriend got strawberry. basically tastes like vanilla. 33 wasted. on overpriced, undersized, awful food. never going back. save your money. they wont be open much longer."

Rodey Pizzeria & Pasta,5,"hi! im a customer from the neighborhood and very loyal too, i eat there like 3 or 4 times peer week. i love the food, waitresss service and the environment. unfortunately, the last two times i had a bad experience, the hostess guy, i think his name is christian, he had a very unprofessional attitude with me and my friends. yesterday we made a reservation for three people, we were siting on the table, then another friend arrived so we asked this guy christian to give us an extra chair for my friend but he was so mean and he right away deny our request without an explanation, i believed this was because the covid19 situation but i looked around  and there was tables of four and six people. then i asked our waitress and she was so nice and she gave us the chair, but this guy christian made her to remove it, we really dont understand why his attitude, also wasnt a busy time so he had a reason to said no. my guest was stand there for 30 minutes while we finish eating, we were so disappointment about this situation. i think you guys need to hire a professional hostess because his attitude well make you loose loyal customers. thanks!"

Villa Mexico Cafe,5,the lady that took my order and made my burrito had no customer service whatsoever. then i go to eat my burrito and the whole thing was falling apart. the beef tasted old and the rice wasnt good. the best part was the sour cream which they obviously didnt make. the seagulls and pigeons liked the burrito though so i guess i paid 10 to feed the birds.

University Grill & Pizza,4,"although the price of their legendary weekend breakfast buffet has gone up a bit to 10 since we first starting coming, it is still an amazing deal, a wonderful atmosphere, and a truly astonishing spread.  weve been for dinner a few times and liked it just fine, the same basic latin menu that a thousand other places nearby also serve, but the winner here is the breakfast on the weekend.   nice interior design too, friendly service, and reasonably priced cocktails."

Siano's Italian Pizzeria & Restaurant,5,"service was pleasant, but very small menu and rather expensive, even for downtown boston."
Bailey & Sage,5,"view and ambience make it a must in fine dining in boston. our entrees  halibut 2, duck, lobster ravioli, scallops  and sidedishes we ordered, mushroom mix and potatoes, were excellent. the tuna tartare apps were good but watery. the octopus and gnocchi apps were great. creme brulee was good but the candied top should have been harder and thicker. the boston cream pie was great.our waiter was not as informative and warmly engaged as one would expect at a restaurant this upscale. my family and i are very friendly and outgoing and i found him a little cold and detached, but he was sufficiently attentive. been here other times and he was par for the course.overall, you cant go wrong for a fine dining experience here."

Pressed Juicery,3,"feels very authentic, was full of people, atmosphere was great. the food was really good,  based on soup broth which and raw  ingredients meet or vegetables you put inside until cooked. very simple, very tasty and also very cheap. the kind of place you werent expecting anything special but afterwards you are sure you are going to come back. i wish it was closer to where i live...service was also great. we sat at the bar and got a detailed explanation on how and what to eat before we understood the concept."

Great Chef Chinese Food at Day Square,5,"dont go there if youre in a hurry theres a long wait unless you call in or order online. i waited half hour for 2 fish  chips, one with salad. a little price for the portions. also, fish kind of bland not alot of seasoning, but it was hot, i liked that. the cashierserver was great to repear customers some he remembered by name. however, he seemed a little annoyed with me, the phone ringing and the delivery guy. my husband suggested we go there since we were in the area and hungry. i didnt feel very welcomed nor was he that attentive to me, i had to keep repeating myself. lastly, i am a firm believer of first come first served but i didnt like standing there looking at my food waiting for it to be bagged and given to me while he packed up delivery orders. why not get me out the door if my stuff is ready and im right here? i wont be back but that probably doesnt matter they seem to get good business."
The Daily Catch North End,2,"great breakfast, good prices, friendly service."
Tawakal Halal Cafe,5,"just ate here last night. its been a long time since i went somewhere and felt like every single dish was spot on, but everything was at hojoko.we ate a lot, haha, and i would order all of it again.highlights were the spicy himachi roll, okonimiyaki, and the chicken wings in gochujang. good lord, those wings.the place has a super fun vibe, the staff are attentive but not distracting.get the coconut fanta bomb, its fun to do and dangerously delicious."

Little Steve's Pizzeria,5,"i was really excited to come here and i really wanted to love it, but i just cant say that i did.  i knew it was touristy but i was also excited for them to make fun of us, i love a good laugh and sarcasm is my specialty.  our waitress was just kind of dull and mad, but not insulting or funny like i was expecting.  way too expensive for the quality of the food, it would be like charging  for applebees, but we were paying for the experience that we didnt really get.  couldnt even get drunk and pretend to enjoy it because i just couldnt bring myself to pay 10 for a beer when i could go a few blocks over and get one for half the price.  would only ever go back if someone else really insisted on it."

Meritage Restaurant,4,great people great atmosphere
Restaurante Montecristo,5,"wow.. really really must visit place. wanted to go to a well known place to try the waygu steak for the first time and this place blew it out of the park. we had a party  of 6 and absolutely no one went away upset. the place is very very awesome. i had to try the waygu a5 prefecture japan steak.....it was only 2oz for 52 but so so so worth the experience .... i have never in my entire life tastes a steak as tender and delicious as this. it literally melted away in my mouth like butter. and that was just the start of the unbelievable feast we had.  i also had the shellfish sampler which was amazing and had lobster tails, oysters , shrimp, and this fantastic crab salad. then we had the soft shell crab special....delicious. and the crudo which was fantastic as well... then for my main i had the american kobe cap steak with blue cheese crust and on the side i asked for it on the side instead of on top i had king crab oscar and asparagus... omg ...it was so good. delicious... super tender and cooked to perfection. the sides with it were outstanding .....the japanese sweet potatoes were seriously the best sweet potatoes i have ever tasted..and then the mushrooms were great as well. drinks were great ...and their drink menu is ridiculous. we ended the night with desserts that were really delicious. the coconut cake came with homemade pineapple and other fruit ice cream that was some of the best ice cream i have ever had.....the creme brulee was great as well...and the chocolate cookies were out of this world. it was a very expensive night but well worth it. service was really good and we will definitely be back for another visit. i seriously want people to know that the waygu steak a5 will literally be the best steak you have ever tasted in your entire life. guaranteed. a must visit. you will spend a lot of money but what you taste for it is worth it. great great place. well done. picture i posted of the kobe steak doesnt do it justice. it was amazing.buddhareview"

BBQ Chicken,4,i really like this place.  their cumin lamb is good.  also their juicy dumplings.
Cafe Jaffa,3,"really really good food. portions, especially for pasta, are also very generous  if youre only moderately hungry, youll be fine with just a pasta dish from the appetizer menu. dessert is also a must have, try the panna cotta or tiramis. prices are on the higher side but completely acceptable given the portions and quality.the interior could use a little more light at night, its so dark that it can be hard to see the menu if youre not sitting directly beneath the lights. otherwise, the feel is definitely very cozy and ideal for getting out of the cold."

Herrera's Mexican Grill,5,i normally enjoy little caesars but third location is terrible.  the pizza was extra thin and over cooked.  i asked for barbeque wings and when they messed up the order and made hot wings they decided our egos be a good idea to just throw a little barbeque on top of it instead of replacing the wings.  the marinara sauce was extremely runny and flavorless.  i dont ever remember being this dissatisfied with little cesars.  but i will never return to boston rd location!

Aceituna Grill,5,"when theres a crowd out front, the bar sometimes charges a cover. no coat check year round, though available during the winter for winter jackets. would not come otherwise with a large bag. theres multiple levels and some dancing. decent place for a drink in this neighborhood. sometimes it is very busy for private events, and it might not be worth waiting on a line that goes past the end of the block in inclement weather. no dress code as this is a bar."

Penang Malaysian Cuisine,3,its a starbucks.
75 on Liberty Wharf,5,pretty damn good
Sixth Gear - Cask & Kitchen,4,hostesses were terrible. they had no command of their floor or seating of people. they gave us 3 different times for our seating and never told us the reasons for it. when we finally did get sat it took 15 minutes before anyone even spoke to us. the only bright spot in our visit was that the waiter understood our frustration and was very attentive.

Johnson's Restaurant and Dairy Bar,3,was good food. was a little pricey but i would go back
Chicken And Rice Guys,5,nice to see a turk once again stealing from a greek.  perhaps they should have named the restaurant cypress.  lets have greek cuisine and call it a turkish restaurant.
South End Pizza and Grill,5,"missing the choices that used to bring me heretwo out of seven liked it since they only get the shrimp. my chicken was killed more than once, and they must have had difficulty, so they dried it out to show the other chickens that they were serious. no cajun spices for salmon, chipotle taken out of the building....apparently that sided with my chicken. the beer...ugh...there wasnt any real sam on tap. i need to stop before i get charged by verizon for using too much bandwidth"
Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery,5,a little pricey but very nice interior
Cafe Quattro,5,food was delicious! chief doesnt allow for additions but white egg lobster omelette was everything! was definitely ignored by waitress who was too busy flirting with the regulars to get her full attention.... our arms were flaring trying to get her attention as she zoomed past us like the roadrunner from the cartoons.....
Boston Chowda Company,5,not enough food. tiny lobster rolls.
China Taste,3,"this place has a beautiful upscale atmosphere inside in the 2nd level. at the same time it offers a lively bar downstairs, or peaceful casual outdoor dining. we went during restaurant week and the selection was excellent. the food was classic american with a modern twist. wine selection is excellent, but more importantly, the staff is knowledgeable and able to make excellent suggestions for pairings."

Slate Bar & Grill,1,"very good food. ive never had good experience with the staff. this time, my girlfriend clearly asked for lobster roll and the waiter didnt hear. which is fine. its crowded! i understand. but i dont want a lecture from the waiter telling me she never asked for the lobster roll, or he would ask what sauce to bring with the lobster roll."
MIDA,5,absolutely love their fried ice cream
Strega Italiano Back Bay,5,took a whole hour from when we pressed the button to order and our food actually arrived. no  napkins. no sauces. all the fried food was rubbery and tasted the same. hot dog was stuck to the wrapper bad enough that it had to be eaten with a fork. drinks were all mixed up size and flavor. i will never be going back! we paid way too much money for a bunch of garbage.

Shun's Kitchen,5,heavenly.
Douzo Sushi,5,this is a great place to get seafood.  the perfect place to get a lobster or just the meat without the mess.  the only thing that keeps this place from a five star is that theyre never friendly.  its always busy and theyre always accommodating but without the smile or small talk.  you can sit and eat or just grab and go.  i would still recommend this as the place to go for seafood.
El Triunfo,5,need better coffee options for brunch
Love Art Sushi,1,the best habachi in metrowest as well as amazing sushi! staff is great.
Acapulcos Mexican Family Restaurant & Cantina,5,"the price is steep, and some people will complain about that, but the amount of food you get for that price is insane. it just never stops, and the quality is right up there, its amazing. i enjoyed this restaurant and i would come back often if i could. you can sign up for their emailing list and get nice coupons though which definitely helps"

Deuxave,5,meh. as you will see from reviews its literally hit or miss. ive had better italian food from local yocal joints near my house. service is bad....really bad. even applebees one of the chinciest restaurants oit there the manager asks how was the food. we had a horrid experience tonight ill never return. cold food bad service is not how i like my evenings....again meh!

Coppa Enoteca,5,"pretty pissed about this venue on how they handled a concert that took place on november 22nd. paid for a concert that everyone waited for 2hrs for and never got in. yeah i understand that it happens, but why not have multiple people say 45 people doing the scannings or multiple doors open for scannings to be done for the line to move along quicker than the show? better yet why not have a walkover scanner go to the near by line and scan the people and having them go in quicker. if going for a concert best to be there like 3hrs early for this place even me being there an hour early didnt help out .this experience was horrible that at least 7080 people if not more were left pissed off in a cold rainy boston night."
M.J. O'Connor's,5,"wellexecuted hotel food served with breathtaking views out over boston harbor looking at the sumptuous boston skyline.   a few nods to local cuisine like the linecaught block island swordfish and the excellent clam chowder.   on warm summer nights, the harborside patio is glowing with fire pits, drinks, and smores.   a decent number of locals stop by since it is at the terminus of a major walking path from jeffries point."
Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery,1,its always a nice place to seat down before any plan near chinatown.
Arya Trattoria,5,"they have great fried clam bellies here. the fish and chips are not bad as well. they dont have great sides, so i would stick with those options for lunch. for breakfast, their sandwiches are okay. a little better than say dd, but not much more."
KO Catering and Pies,4,"cocktail list is deadly.  too many great drinks to choose from, youll want to try them all!  the ribs are out of this world.  nice selection of japanese whisky.  staff is attentive and pleasant.  we ordered more food to go because it was soo good,"

Avenue One,4,dont like the bread
Bangkok Pinto,5,"it was noontime and there were 4 people behind the counter and still it took 15 minutes to make a burger and fries. also, i ordered a cheddar bacon burger and it came smothered with onions and bbq sauce. it wasnt bad but i didnt ask for that so wasnt expecting it. lettuce tomato pickle onion would have been great. expensive too! eight dollars and change for a 4oz burger"
Agoro's Pizza Bar & Grill | Boston,5,excellent boneless wings

Dimitrio's House of Pizza,5,"the service culture at this particular location is terrible.  only thing that keeps this place afloat is the location to the ballpark. were locals, and have given this place a couple a shots and only gets worse everytime. nobody in the damn place seems to care. spend your money elsewhere."

Yum Mee Garden,4,"this place is pricey, but they make good drinks.  i got a drink called smoke  a pancake. they put dry ice in the drink so it was overflowing with co2 smoke. really cool looking! they put a tiny pancake on the rim, which tasted like a nillla wafer.i also got their crab cake bar bite which was fried and rather bland.  my friend tried the buffalo bites which were light for fried chicken and pretty good."

SUBWAY®Restaurants,4,"blue fish was so pretty good, good portions, good selection of drinks and oysters."
Rabia's Dolce Fumo,5,"quick service, order was accurate."
jm Curley,4,"as expected, and thats a good thing. we stepped out onto kneeland street at 1145 on a rainy cold day, with time for just a quick lunch. i suggested pho, but my lunch partner is not a big fan, so we settled on panera, which was maybe 2 blocks away. we were 2nd in line and a few minutes later done ordering. my 3 bean chili was good if not memorable, she was pleased with her soup and salad. we got our food in about 10 minutes. the place was warm and reasonably clean. the wifi was good, so we stayed a bit after we had finished. we easily made our 1 pm appointment. now all this might not sound terribly exciting, but it more than met our needs. you can depend on panera in these situations, but you probably already know this "

Cask 'n Flagon,5,highly recommend it. there are only like 8 seats in the restaurant. the broth and noodles are great! ive been to some ramen shops in japan.. this is comparable. the only thing is that the meat and toppings can be hotter. the soup is very hot tho. everything else is awesome!!! highly recommend it to my friends
McGreevy's Boston,3,the best seafood place ever
Back Deck,4,good filet and lobster
The Halal Guys,4,mediocre fast food vegan restaurant. the burger patties taste stale and bland not fresh prepared. i suspect they are frozen and then barely heated. one of our patties was still cold and needed to be reordered. i suggest replacing lettuce in burgers with kale or spinach. beets ketchup and curry mustard nice condiments for sweet potato fries. veggie galaxy has better tasting burgers. cashier forgot half my order. bonus they accept levelup app.

Marlborough Super Buffet,5,"its a boston market. the experience depends on the staff and management  some shifts irs good and some shifts its bad.as for the food, it is consistent  except for the chicken soup, which is sometimes really good and sometimes too salty. but it is usually loaded with chicken.the rest of the food is average. dont kid yourself.on the healthiness of the sides. they are buttery and very few of them are what you would call healthy, but they are ok once in a while.wheelchair access is good, if you can get a parking place near the entrance... they have ramped spots.however, a decent renovation has resulted in overly large columns that while technically up to code make it impossible to pass if a car pulls right up to the walkway because its hood  bumper impinges into your path of travel.a very poor design."

Big Apple Restaurant,4,"theres a good variety of food at reasonable prices. if youre on a budget, or trying to feed a small herd if children, you cant go wrong. it does get hectic early on with families coming in, but its never too hard to find a seat. matbe worse on open house days, but still manageable. things youll find pizza, cheeseburgers, hot hogs, chicken fingers, fries, onion rings, chips, 2 choices of soup, a salad bar, a bythepound hot food choice varies, frozen novelty deserts, soda, juice, coffee, beer, and even wine."

Inna's Kitchen - Boston Public Market,5,"terrible sandwich, hardly any chicken, no avocado. way too pricey"
La Famiglia Giorgio's Restaurant,5,"idk what the hype is all about regarding snobiness..i got really excited to be treated like dirt for no reason. host to waiter, treated us with complete respect an hospitality. nothing about our appearance said hi society. im not sure if people are intimidated by being in the presence of professionals invested in maintaining an upscale image, but the crowd was not as aggressive as people made it seem. it was a mix of various types. one thing all these notes had in common though, was they had to be able to afford the menu prices. not cheap at all nor should it be considering the atmosphere. lamb dish was very good and drinks did the job. this place is for show and is all about presenting a high end image which translates in its cost. definitely a hidden gem and if you cant afford it then just dont go.."
VENICE PIZZA,5,good food and often live music. bar staff are friendly and service is fast. unfortunately we heard some derogatory comments from customers about irish. in an irish bar?
Fiouna's Restaurant,5,to much to list here. 4 star family dining. huge portions of traditional italian american fare. some of the options are totally spot on for what youd expect. the others are lack luster and pretty bland. id give 3.5 stars if it was an option. seems as though the chateau restaurant has overall as a company gone a bit down hill. it may be time to update ingredients and add no precooked food as a staple and the glory of old could return.
The Pour House,5,just aint the same no more
Harvard Gardens,5,"unlike the other reviewers, my experience with the service was actually okay. however, the lightingatmosphere is terrible, and the food was disgusting. the crab was old, and my steak must have just come out of the freezer, as well as being way undercooked. no sear whatsoever. will not be back here."

Crazy Good Kitchen (C.G.K ON NEWBURY),4,"i went there not expecting much, but foods were great. had spaghetti meatball, salty pig pizza, and a salad. they were all delicious! craft beer selection was great and i settled on a pale ale. regular pale ale had 5 alcohol and came in a regular glass. ipa indian pale ale had 8 alcohol and came in a smaller glass. bigger is always better! staffs were super nice. the closest non street parking was across the road on 131 dartmouth st. dont park at copley! it was expensive even with a stamp i paid the price of ignorance. park at prudential and score a validation from a nice salesperson!"

Tavitas Mexican,5,"this is a lovely, intimate restaurant tucked among the hotels surrounding copley square. service is attentive and warm, tables are spaced well, and noise level is just right for fine dining. the food is excellent, some of the best ive had in boston. pastas are hand made and delicious, meats are well sourced and prepared beautifully. desserts are innovative. spirits selection is well curated, and drinks are well balanced. only down mark would be the bar staff attitude. we started our evening with a cocktail at the bar, and most staff seemed distant and arrogant, and didnt match the warm welcoming attitude of the front and wait staff. while the restaurant was full during our meal, the bar seats were empty, and this was not surprising. take note, sorellina."

Capitol Coffee House,5,got to love clover and the freshly sourced ingredients in all made to order items.
Chuck E. Cheese,3,"food was alright but the staffs were not professional at all! we waited for almost 20 minutes for the food to come because one of the waiter decides she wants to bring the food to her friends table first. her friend just came in to the restaurant and all of a sudden, she got the food right away. not only that, when our food arrives it is the different order the we originally ordered at the beginning. the toast was not like we expected and it was not that delicious. the pictures are just to show off but really the taste is just okay... the ice cream is the worst by the way."
Pho Basil,5,crazy small place.  would be twice as large if the door swung out.  breakfast sandwiches ok but plan to take out.

Wingz & Tingz,5,"stopped by here for the fort point holiday stroll and had an wonderful time talking to staff on the lunch side of the restaurant, so i decided to come back for dinner. cocktails are creative, pretty expensive, but the bartenders are on their game. we shared three plates peruvian chicken, lamb meatballs, and sunchoke pierogis. everything was delicious and the chicken was exceptional, with a spicy roumelade atop crispy potatoes. ive had tapas from several restaurants and it would be nice if the portions are a bit larger for the price, though tchicken made its value. service great all around. ill definitely be back to taste more of the menu!"

Little Asia Restaurant,4,"the food here is simple and done well. come hungry because the portions are large and heavy, but you probably wont have trouble finishing your meal. fried chicken and pulled pork mac n cheese were great dishes and the rumwhiskey cocktails they have are prepared very well. they play loud punkrap music so it wasnt the most ideal place for a date, but thats really on me for not looking into it further and we still really enjoyed our meal.the only downside is the price. 100 bill for 2 people that only got 1 drink each. i would go again, but probably would skip the appetizer since the main course is filling enough."

El Basha Grille & Bar,4,"be skeptical of anyone who suggests this is the best thai food in the area. the vibe and service are great if thats what you are into. most of the time i have ordered the food and have been left wanting, especially for the price. its been awhile since i have even ordered here and cannot recall taste specifics, but thai dish just around the corner contains much more flavor, and homemade family love consistently with any comparable dish you may order id imagine.two stars is admittedly harsh, but how can i recommend anything higher with a thai restaurant with vastly superior cuisine literally a stones throw away?"
Shin Hakata Ramen,5,dirty
Douzo Sushi,5,i usually really like this sonic. but today the drivethru was pretty busy so i pulled up to one of the driveup menus and parked. after i ordered it took 45 minutes to get my order. i understand that it was busy. but it really needed to have more staff to handle the amount of customers.
Rodey Pizzeria & Pasta,4,i love breugers but this one is the worst. always slow and disorganized.
Siano's Italian Pizzeria & Restaurant,5,"service is always great and relatively quick, in my experience. i find the apps to be really good, they also let you taste two beer samplers before ordering beer. i was less impressed by their main courses though, depending on the selection. liked onion tower, cheese curds, shiitake mushroom noodles, and the featured pork sandwich. i was neutral about the hot chicken sandwich. not a fan of the carbonara  just seemed like undercooked noodles coated in cream. definitely a great place for beer and apps though!"

RUKA,5,good beer selection
Chilli Thai Bistro,5,very fast service
Sweet Cheeks Q,5,"what a wonderful dinner.  the food was superb, but the experience was not.based upon other reviewers, i believe my single experience was pretty similar to others.  first, you arrive and stand in line waiting to enter the restaurant and be seated.  we waited over an hour.  and while standing in line, youre likely to hear comments from those walking by commenting on the silliness of waiting for so long especially given the option to be immediately seated at other italian restaurants.once seated, i felt rushed to order drinks, appetizers, and entrees as quickly as possible.  i suppose that makes sense, given the line outside the door however part of dining is the experience and this was rushed.  on top of that, it was hot inside the restaurant because the kitchen is right there possibly in front of you.  and youre jammed in there.  a waitress kept walking into my chair while serving the guests behind me.  she never apologized.  i suppose its an hourly occurrence.its cash only.so the food was quite good but given the proximity of other italian restaurants, i am not sure if the wait is justified.  so, four stars for an excellent meal but an experience that wasnt great."
Whiskey's,2,"love this place. same people working, super nice. really great esp late night. open til 4am!"

Soup Shack JP,5,"i live right next to this place. i tried it out today and ordered a meal online. the burger patty was ordered medium, but came out as well done with charring sticking to the bottom. the fries were soggy with grease as well.overall the quality of the food was well below salem standard. i would not recommend."
City Table,5,"best mexican food in boston, period. dont look any further."
Maggiano's Little Italy,5,"the waitress was very nice and fast! i loved the  salad  definitely for healthy eaters ! pizza...... i loved the crust, but the topping was little too much and super greasy.... though we got the table right away, even it was lots of people there. the price and variety of food is perfect! great place for family and students!"

Maxine's On Saint James,5,"clam chowder, skillet breakfast, and eggs benedict were all delicious, but i wish the portions were larger.monkey bread and carnitas scramble were delicious. the hashbrown waffle was not what i expected a regular waffle with potato sticks on top. not worth it for 24, but it was just an easter special.id definitely come back again."

Union Bar and Grille,2,"quite possibly the coolest bar in the city of boston. it can be hard to get into on weekend nights without reservations, but once you do, you wont be disappointed. yvonnes is part speakeasynightclub with a large hotel bary atmosphere. very tasty and interesting menu. great for cocktails and mingling."
Union Oyster House,5,"the absolute hands down best pizza around for  real,  they have great subs and gray prices,  i love devitos"
Soup Shack JP,3,food was great and at affordable price however i was served a glass of water with a peice of gum and hair on it and at the end of our meal the waitress threw a napkin on our plate of fries while we were still eating them. id probably go back but id watch out for hair and be more aggressive with guarding my food.
High Spot Deli,5,"really great overall experience. fresh, delicious, and creative ingredients, incredibly fast and easy ordering. highly recommend"

Texas Roadhouse,5,"one of my favorite higher end restaurants in boston. your classic american style menu with an assortment of beef, chicken and fish dishes that are simple but delicious. i will start off with their charcuterie  cheese platter and then i usually order one of their steak options. they also make a mean whiskey smash that is my must have during every visit. the staff are wonderful and always provide top notch service, making you feel welcome and tending to every request in a timely manner. highly recommend for a special occasion or holiday event, just make sure to make a reservation."
Pollo Campero,3,called in prior to coming to the restaurant and the gentleman over the phone was so pleasant and courteous! arrived and was met with the same courtesy by the woman in the front. sweet and spicy wings are great albeit not warm. will definitely be back sooner than later.
Tuscan Kitchen,5,i would love to actually say i am writing a bad complaint about the food but i did not get a chance to have any! i walked into this establishment at approximately 330 pm and there was no one at the front desk. i looked around and spotted a team meeting taking place. the phone rang a hostessserver stared at the front and did not budge. i was there for a few minutes. your customer service is horrible and i wish i had read these reviews before stepping into this place.

Stella Restaurant,1,"good food, quick and easy."
Peach Farm,5,"love it, great food and service."

Herrera's Mexican Grill,1,"good pizza, little bit of a wait but it was busy so its ok, kids ate and didnt whine so they liked it."
Olympic House of Pizza,5,best home fries ever
CLINK. and The Liberty Bar,5,this being a newer location of course they are still trying to perfect everything. drive thru and inside lines are always long but the wait isnt usually that bad. the biggest suggestion i can make is to try your beverage before you leave. almost every time i have been here i end up leaving with colored soda water because of the lack of syrup in the machine. i work in close proximity and am here once or twice a week and despite the few complaints i have its still one of the better options around. blows the mcds up the street or of the water but not the 5 guys. all in all its worth a stop if this is what your looking for.
Lucky Cafe,5,they were fast
Denny's,1,closed permanently.
Champions,4,"great brunch, so much food, nice young crowd"
Purple Shell,5,we order the same dishes every time and the food is pretty consistent. be sure to read your receipt because they sometimes include gratuity on the check and do not tell you this has happened with parties less than 6 on numerous occasions.
Tavern In The Square Allston,1,"i walked in for the first time ever, wanted a beef patty with coco bread and cheese...the woman was so rude! i said do you still have beef patties? she said no with a nasty attitude, and went onto the next customer. i was gonna buy a plate since they had no patties, but since she didnt bother to ask me if i wanted anything else, and was rude and went right on to the next person, why would i want to buy anything now. sad, if you dont know customer service, you shouldnt open a business. i will never go back there. there is too many good jamaican food places in the city to have to deal with people that rude. and vaughns fish is right next door who has the best fish in town..so thats where i ended up. dont waste your time going here, unless you like rude service."
Burro Bar South End,4,translated by google is very goodoriginales muy bueno
sweetgreen,4,nice sushi with nice service. they are kind.

Brasserie JO,4,"the food is really good. the employees and business owners are very kind. this is not a fast food restaurant so be prepared to wait 10 to 15 minutes for your name to be called to grab your clean brown paper bag with sturdy handles. in my opinion, this small vegan parlor is a great addition to the updated four corners location. truly. oasis has such a good neighborhoodinviting community get together vibe due to the clientele that it tends to attract. its always a friendly experience... plus the music makes you want to dance your best afrobeat moves while waiting for your favorite vegan dish of the day... tho there is likely to be a bit of a wait i shall return to this place, soon.  p.s. the coconut lentils are a must!  yum yum yum"

Ba Lẹ Restaurant,5,very kind and respectful. it was my birthday and they gave out a cake.
Brigham Circle Chinese Food,3,this was my first time at papa razzi trattoria and ill say itll be my last time going to papa razzi trattoria. the wait staff was awful no came to serve us at all we had to complain to the hostess about it before we finally got a waiter. once we got a waiter im not sure but our waiter was awful and gave us attitude when they got to our table like we are a waste of this persons time. we never got any water or bread at our table where all of the other tables were given it by default. the only saving grace was the food it was awesome i thoroughly enjoyed it. in conclusion i would say only do take out from papa razzi trattoria the food is awesome some of the best pasta i ever had its just too bad that the wait staff was absolutely awful.usually i wouldnt go back after a terrible experience a few month ago. however it was my friends birthday and she chose there for a birthday meal. against my better judgment we went and this time it was a much better experience then the last time i went. everything was perfect we were seated right away and they brought us bread and water and our drinks was served fast along with our food. thank you for the big improvement in service than my last time i there. the first time i was there it was a minor problem and ill definitely come back in the near future.

Peach Farm,4,the food was fine. it was the fact that it needs cleaning.  the bathrooms were a mess. tables left with all the dishes left on them. i havent been to a friendlys in a while and i probably wont be back to this one anytime soon.
South Ocean,5,it was a bar. there were drinks and football was on.
Manà Escondido Cafe,1,"great views and food. the bar seems like its too large though and if it were smaller there would be more room for people. the view by the water is great if you can get seats there. the service was extremely fast for the two crab rolls we ordered. this place is very crowded in the summer, but just a normal restaurant crowded in the winter  they have heat lamps. i havent tried their lobster roll or other seafood, but i hear its delicious. this is a must go to restaurant location in boston."

Chung King Rick's Cafe,4,"went on a weekday night and it was still packed, definitely need a reservation to get in. the small calamari was definitely enough for 2 people. also got the burrata which was great. and ordered the linguine alla pescatore got it with the white wine sauce which was okay. wonder if it wouldve been better with the fra diavolo. my husband enjoyed the veal panza."
Sweet Life,2,"i had never been here but met up with some coworkers for dinner. we got some guacamole to start and it was great! the cocktails were delicious. it was slightly cheesy decor etc, not taste, ha, felt like it catered to the club crowd. it would be perfect for a girls night or something like that. food was decent! the ambience just wasnt my cup of tea."

Italian Express Pizzeria,4,"update about 10cone for these unique creations. they are well worth the price when in the mood for more than a ice cream scoop.ive been to this location several times now and usually go with their classic ice cream fish cone. todays line was massive and just chaotic. after paying for my order there wasnt any room to sit or stand. there were now two dogs in the store, the first of which wouldnt stop begging the entire time. my order was first passed to somebody else who said its not mine then finally to me.certainly wasnt my favorite experience here, better off making my own ice cream waffle at home."

Back Deck,5,"this restaurant is oozing with all the right ingredients to becoming one of my favorite places to hang at in boston. a few notes... the bartenders serve up delicious boozy cocktails the food is gastropub style the ambiance is comfortable and industrial no frills, but still speciali love gastropubs like jm curley  cozy, friendly staff, and plenty of great oktoberfest beers. and the mac n cheese is decadent. its served up in a skillet with your choice of barbecue pork or plain. do yourself a favor and try the bbq pork. it is heavy, but will make your tastebuds swoon.on to the drinks, jms has a nice selection of local beers from microbreweries all over new england and from the left coast, theres plenty of autumnal 21st amendment beers.give this place a try and order the classic macaroni and cheese or the 9oz burger and leave full and happy."

Johnson's Restaurant and Dairy Bar,5,"i have been to taiwan cafe for so long, i cant recall exactly when was the first time.  when i moved to this area 20 years ago, chinese restaurant was either cantoneseamericana banquetdim sum or small mandarin joints. i grew up in taiwan and was longing for a good pork chop or loo minced pork on rice. this was the only place then and probably still so now. i read peoples comments on the service and agree most of them but i cant help but remember the day i got my son to taste the fried pig intestine and he is hooked since. so i have to give it a five star just ......"

Hei La Moon Restaurant,5,typical chipotle. i like the outdoor tables
Al Dente Ristorante,5,"outdoor seating was nice, and the staff was very pleasant, but the food was slightly disappointing, especially the ceviche which, being a ceviche bar, should be the star of the show. the portions are a bit too small. lot of potential for this place, just focus less on the design of the dishes and more on the quality, and make the ceviches basically all plates  just a bit bigger. they are meant to be shared and at the moment its not enough. would return in a few weeks to see how it develops"
Cafeteria Boston,4,"good hibachi, favorite roll is the gorshie maki."
Seoul Jangteo,4,"tldr cheap, delicious and customizableif you are looking for a hearty meal and your wallet is looking mighty thin. then this is the place for you. the lowest price will start from around 6  7 dollars.surprisingly, the low price does not mean low quality. they will give a delicious meal with high quality ingredients. the dont cut back to save costs, you will get what you deserve.allergic or on a diet? no worries, they will completely customize your burger to your requirements."
Boston Pizza & Grill,3,ive been bringing friends and my kids here for 30 years. better than the nearby tourist places. if youre in the area grab a couple of slices and premade calzones. warm in your toaster. or take your slices to enjoy in the north end.
The Ginger Man,4,good.music way too loud tho.
Angora Cafe,4,great as all other cheesecake factories! i ordered key lime cheesecake which was delicious and fettuccine alfredo with chicken which was good. it was pretty crowded around 12 pm during the week most probably because of mrs conference. so make sure no conferences are happening when you go there!
Hojoko,5,"clean  nice looking place. didnt love the empanadas, the dough tastes a little weird."
Friendly's,1,terrible service. rude managers. at 11pm they didnt let us sit down because they dont want to clean the tables and told us it is standing room only. despicable. avoid at all costs. id give them zero stars if possible.
Wing's Kitchen,3,best seafood ever!!!!
Linguine's Italian Eatery,4,superb atmosphere and super friendly service. the food was crisp and delightful. will clearly recommend this restaurant to my friends. convenient rates and big portions. keep up the great work.

Eastern Pearl,5,those kids at the bakery have like no customer skills. they also have zero communication skills. trying to order for takeout..? good luck with that!

Hot Eastern,5,great soup dumplings! very flavorful broth!!
JMP Fine Indian Cuisine,5,great vibes. friendly staff. quality food priced accordingly. will return.
North Street Grille,4,"i am rating this place 4 star for the quality of the food. it is a comparatively expensive place for the food you are getting however it is ok considering the location of the place. thus, i would not downgrade to a star for that reason.the service was bad. they really need to work on the service issue. waiters were clueless. nobody knew which table they are supposed to bus, they dont listen you and they dont take notes. the worse is that they forget about what you order for. if you ask for something that is a not dish, good luck. we had to ask for a slice of a lemon for our drinks five times, it took four waiters to figure out how to get it in 30 minutes. we asked for refills for our drinks and didnt come at all."
Genki Ya - Boston,5,"this is a highly popular dining  grocery shopping destination, but it doesnt do it for me. too crowded and a smoky mens restroom. the simplest slice of pizza is too oily, too cold and too overpriced at 3.20. the cashiers looked genuinely puzzled when i asked them to heat it up. there is a wine selection on site, but i doubt the legality of allowing partaking patrons to leave the dedicated wine shop, wine tasting area and dining areas to wander through through the larger store, sloshing other patrons on the way."
Whaling in Oklahoma,5,its a new store so the inside looks clean. there is no drivethru.
Starbucks,3,great food for lunch
Saltie Girl,5,really fun spot with dollar oysters from 56 on fridays
Starbucks,4,love the pizza. just seems like they are doing you a favor by selling it to you.
Brazilian Steak Grill,4,"had a cheesy cover band that played the likes of billy jean on a saturday night. terrible band, id avoid it, kind of a tourist trap."
The Halal Guys,2,"came here years ago when they had small tomato slices on the pizza and it was delicious back then now their pizza taste like frozen pizza, just plain nasty and you be better of getting digorno or california pizza the frozen kind. im highly disappointed at the wait time when nobody is in there so i dont know there excuse for that"
Pueblo Viejo,4,"whatever you do, get something with spicy whipped feta and an order of donuts"
Little River Inn,5,great food. very accomodating staff.
Liberty Bell,4,"just another asian buffet, good price"
Local 149,4,one of my favorite places in boston! and one of the best middle east places in the city!go there for brunch to enjoy their kunafee!
Waterline,1,"if i could rate them 0 stars, i would! do not order from here. i ordered online at 10am for an 1145am order and at around 1210 pm, it still had not arrived! i called them and he told me that they didnt have any drivers to deliver my order. he said that it would still be another 30 minutes before i would receive my order. 30 minutes later, the order had still not arrived so we called again and he still  didnt have anyone to deliver the order. his only explanation was that they commonly get too busy to deliver orders. this is not your clients problem! if you need more employees, hire more employees. either that or tell your clients that you are unable to do delivery only pickup until you have enough drivers. not professional at all!"
Semolina Kitchen + Bar,5,comfort food was good.
Rose's Chinese Restaurant,5,didnt have the best experience

Legal Sea Foods,5,"food and service was good enough, but absolutely no vegetarian options on the menu. plenty for pescatarians, however"
Citizen Public House & Oyster Bar,4,would give it negative stars if i could. went there last night at 6pm for my daughters 2nd birthday with 10 family members. we were seated quick but the good stops there. our server was not very attentive and we waited excessively long for some of our drinks and some of the glasses werent even clean. we asked for fries and got maybe a small handful in 3 baskets and were never brought any more. we ordered by about 620630 and asked for the kids meals to be brought out first as one of the kids is disabled and eats slowly. they brought out my daughters food and one persons meal and then we continued to wait until after 730pm and nobody else had gotten their food after waiting an hour. we then asked the server and he said one of the cooks had walked out earlier and the manager was cooking so things were taking longer than normal. we could tell the servers were all aggrivated by the kitchen situation and several other patrons had been waiting over a half hour for their orders. we then noticed one of our meals was under the heat lamps and had been sitting there for quite some time without being brought over. we waited maybe another 15 minutes and had heard that they had just started making the rest of our orders. it was about 1.5 hours by then and we got tired of waiting as the other child still hadnt gotten his food and was getting upset. i got up to tell them we couldnt wait any longer that we were walking out without our meals because we had been waiting so long. the manager was very rude about it and didnt even apologize for the problems and ruining my 2yr old daughters birthday dinner. we will never return to this place again.
Legal Test Kitchen,4,best steak n cheese!
Sarku Japan,3,"the staff are rude and judgmental. they think everyone of color that hang around the copley park are homeless and use drugs. i use to like going to thst wendys till i started getting treated like i was a criminal,being followed when i went to utilize the bathroom. and i say to eat i cbeing watched and when i tried having..a conversation they were rude and dismissed me as i was nothing to them. i went back a few weeks after and they still had the same attitude so i stop going to eat thereive seen them treat many people that way. especially the homeless which breaks my heart to see."

Canton House,5,"my friends and i visited on a saturday evening and ordered korean dishes. the ban chan korean side dishes were pretty sparse for 3 people, and we had to ask for additional kimchi halfway through the meal. the main dishes kimchi jjigae and deok mandu guk were decent, not great, but arrived piping hot and in great quantity more than enough for leftovers. the restaurant is nice, but pretty tiny it was awkward for guests and servers alike to navigate the dining area. they play older kpop videos on a tv above the bar area, which is fun very big bang biased which almost earns it an extra star from me!. a good value and fun atmosphere solid for korean food."
Thornton's,5,"the first fancy restaurant that i visited in 2019!its good and really fine dining restaurant.great services and tasty food.the price is kind of ok for me. i ate seafood a lot, so the check was a little bit high, but i think its worth it...they also have really big private rooms for a large group of people.very good. should give a try.

Strega,4,the best chicken around
Union Park Pizza,4,"place is very nice, id say great for date night or hang with the boys at the bar, been here often enough. bartenders are always nice with a sense of humor which is huge in my book. chicken wings are nice could be a tad hotter for buffalo wings. but tasty enough. had the beacon hill burger basic lettuce tomato and onion, they even gave me yellow onions instead of purple. shoestring fries not my favorite but pretty good. burger was pretty good."

Love Art Sushi,5,"translated by google we wanted hot drinks and there were no notices of the quantities and prices visible from the whole menu. while we were looking for some type of informative poster 2 clients were in line and there were 4 or 5 more people waiting for their order. we ordered 1 medium cappuccino and a small beats and obviously because of the number of people we knew what to have patience, 4 more people came to the line and little by little the coffee was empty. they attended to everyone, including the 4 who arrived afterwards and our request gave no clue to appear. finally appeared the beats, to mention that the cappuccino was missing, to resolve the eagerness give us a different hot drink called green matcha. we already gave up and accepted that drink, after so much waiting and not seeing a suggestion box. then, they give us the cappuccino. we had already tasted the matcha, its flavor was not pleasant because of the bitterness and that had added a bit of the sugar envelope. the cappuccino more water than coffee. a very negative experience due to the wait, the attention, the quality of the product served, the clients attention to improve, lack of caps or protection of the workers hair, cleaning of the napkin areas, organization of the pallets to supply the showcases and absence or poor visibility of the recommendation box, yes it exists. in short, lets hope that point is better.originalqueramos bebidas calientes y no estaban los avisos de las cantidades y precios visibles de la totalidad del menu. mientras buscbamos algn tipo de cartel informativo 2 clientes estaban en la fila y estaban 4 o 5 personas ms esperando su pedido. pedimos 1 capuchino mediano y un late pequeo y obviamente por la cantidad de personas sabamos qu tocaba tener paciencia llegaron 4 personas ms a la fila y poco a poco el caf se desocupo. atendieron a todos, incluso los 4 que llegaron despus y nuestro pedido no daba pista de aparecer. por fin apareci el late, al mencionar que faltaba el capuchino, por resolver el afan nos dan una bebida caliente diferente llamada matcha verde. ya nos dimos por vencido y aceptamos esa bebida, despus de tanta espera y no ver un buzn de sugerencias. luego, nos dan el capuchino.ya habamos probado el matcha, su sabor no fue agradable por lo amargo y eso qu le haba agregado un poco del sobre de azcar.  el capuchino ms agua qu caf. una experiencia muy negativa tanto por la espera, la atencin, la calidad del producto servido, la atencin del cliente por mejorar, falta de gorras o proteccin del cabello de las trabajadoras, aseo de las zonas de servilletas, organizacin de las estibas de surtir las vitrinas y ausencia o poca visibilidad del buzn de recomendacines, s es que existe. en fin, esperemos que est punto mejore."

Tilted Kilt Pub and Eatery (Boston),5,"odd restaurant format that seems to try to bridge traditional new england fare usually served in shacks or sitdown restaurants with upscale fastcasual and adding a touch of gourmet spin.the lobster roll is, by no means a classic lobster roll, as it is served on a steamed bun rather than a baked roll. the lobster is fresh and tasty and in a flavorful mayobased sauce. the lobster soup is on the salty side, but rather hearty with a clear broth and bolstered by abundant mushrooms. the crispy chicken sandwich has an asian flair coupled with a sweet mustard sauce.all in all, a reasonable dining experience, albeit overpriced. i would not recommend for tourists, but for locals with spare change it could be a pleasant departure from traditional new england flavors.i"

House of Siam,5,"you cannot eat at figs and not order the asparagus frites. the asparagus spears are blanched, breaded in panko, and lightly fried. they are served on arugula with honey mustard aioli. it is an amazing appetizer because the asapargus flavor comes through with a delightful crisp exterior. it is a simple but well executed idea! i got portabello. it has garlic, oil, mushroom puree made out of portabello stems, fontina, roasted red onion, and truffle oil."

Fuji at Ink Block,5,"i did not enjoy the temperature super cold we all we sitting with our jackets in, that they place you in the far end corner next to the restrooms while there were enough free tables the place did not fill up during the evening, the music was off more bar, almost club like and the staff  very impatient, removing plates while half of the party was still eating from the appetizersthe food was good half pasta portions are really small. however the whole experience gave us a bad taste and the food could simply not compensate"
Donovan's Irish Pub,5,"impressive!i came here after work with some colleagues after hearing the buzz in a lot of online articles written about this place. we had a blast! there is definitely a wow factor to the whole ambiance. it serves up a cool but not too cool and welcoming vibe. i will definitely come back again.prosdeliciously strong drinkssurprisingly good beer and wine selectionmouthwatering appetizers and entrees pork buns, crab rangoon, fried chicken, not to mention the sushi rolls!really fun and cozy environmentconsstiff drinks come with a price tag to matchneed to make reservationno signage yet tho i kind of like that?overall thoughtsim glad we went. there is nothing like it here in boston and it lived up to the hype. i will be back. i just hope it doesnt get over crowded and they maintain the cool vibe."

Umai,5,"i ordered take out.  thats rolling the dice with this location and usually the house wins.  because one time i ordered, they told me 25 minutes, i went 35 minutes, and they still werent ready and made me wait.  after 10 more minutes i cancelled the order and left.  last time i ate in i sent the order back wings and just had a soda.  see, they have an issue with applying sauces and rubs.  its sloppy and scarce  they just dont do it.  especially the rubs.  the last time it was the same.  just get their seasoning and make yourself home."

Supreme Pizza,5,"my wife and i moved from the west coast and weve been looking for a pizza joint like this since we got here. after over a dozen attempts weve finally found it. the pizza here hits the spot. its the right blend of good cheese, good sauce, and most importantly, good crust. new york style has its place but it doesnt have the cravingtogluttonousfill factor that makes you want to eat the whole pizza, sometimes with success, even though you were full after the second slice. this pizza tastes great for dinner and then cold for the next three meals. if youre wanting a satisfying yet possibly painful pizza experience, grab a pizza here. you wont be dissapointed. also the garlic cheese bread is amazing."

Beijing Cafe,5,"dinner reviewso confused how this place only has 3.5 stars as of 4719 because we had what i would regard as a 5 star dining experience.wait we made a reservation for 730 and got there right on time and were seated only a few minutes after. for walkins, they were saying it would be an hour and a half wait so if you want to come here, best to try and make a reservation.setting the restaurant has some eclectic wall decor, including a wall lined with fauxleaves and a red neon sign that reads talk dont cook rice which really didnt make sense to me maybe im missing something. usually neon signs say something that people want to take a picture in front of...not this one.bar  drinks i usually dont comment on bars at restaurants as i usually dont spend much time at them not a huge drinker over here but this one was really cool with interesting lighting and had a southeast asiantiki vibe. i had the el tio which came in a tall glass with mint and i would definitely recommend it.they also have a lot of specialty large drinks which you can order for larger groups. one is called the galleon which comes in a pirate ship and they play the song from pirates of the carribean as they bring it out. you have to have at least 6 people to order it how responsible of them. a fun group of 20somethings ordered this while we were there and it was fun to at least be a part of their galleon experience.service our waitress was so friendly and gave amazing recommendations for the food below.food the food is what earned this place 5 stars which is how it should be. we could have ordered so many things on the menu but everything we had we loved. i guess it just warrants another trip back. below is what we ordered, ranked in order of our favorites.brown butter laksa  ironically, this is the dish we almost didnt consider getting as my mom who i came with doesnt like fishy fish so she had her concerns but the waitress rightfully assured us that it wasnt fishy and she was right. this fish was tender and fell apart in the warm curry which we ate every last drop of. i would recommend getting a side of rice to soak up all the goodness.crispy pork ribs  dang, these ribs were perfectly spicy and came in a charred ginger chili sauce which i also poured over rice. they were crispy on the outside but had a good amount of meat on the bone.coconut chili shrimp  i wish we got extra orders of these...these shrimp were crisped up by the coconut coating and the chili garlic glaze gave it a nice spiciness.seasonal greens  these greens were cooked down and slightly on the vinegary side which i like. they provided a nice healthylighter balance to the heaviness of everything else we were eating.lamb roti  something had to be at the bottom but these were still delicious. this should be a testament to how good everything was. think of roti like a quesadilla but this was filled with braised lamb and mint cilantro jam...it was my jam.i will definitely be back to tiger mama. i hear they have really good brunch so i want to try that out!"
Sonsie,5,the gold standard for seafood on the east coast. worth every one of the small mountain of pennies youll shovel over for dinner.

Maria's Taqueria,3,"pretty cool spot. the food was really good but it was hard to make alterations to some of the dishes, which was a bummer. there are about six basic dishes to start with from which you can change the base grain or salad, protein, and dressings.i might go back. staff was very friendly and it was neat to watch the robots prepare my food."
Piattini,1,"this is in my opinion the best  in boston  hell in mass  the sauce is the best not sweet and with the perfect seasoning, the cheese  pepperoni are my favorite and this is the only pizza i will eat completely including the crust which gets that pepperoni  cheese flavor so its a sin to let all that flavor go to waste"

Papa John's Pizza,4,"if you dont speak or read chinese, just look around and point at the amazing ethnic dishes you see! avoid pupu platters because those things dont reflect the authenticity and cultural cuisine the chefs here can produce. if you speak and read, ask about the off menu specials, the chefs are always pushing something new and they only tell the close friends and family."

Alibi,5,"i ordered the impossible burger and fries. the burger itself and the fries were good, but the caramelized onions were a big miss. they were cooked to the point of being an indistinct mush, and were congealed and cold on top of the burger. unappetizing and cemented to the top so i couldnt take them off.i waited at the online pickup spot as directed, but the workers working the front ignored me for 10 minutes, until i caught their eye for longer than a second. the bag sitting behind them the whole time turned out to be my order. it seems like its supposed to go in the shelves i have access to, but they never put it there."
Itadaki,5,"finally made it,my first time around i drove a long way and found out after i ordered to go that no credit cards.they do have a atm but i only use my machines due to some past issues so i had to run the streets of boston to find  my bank.  this when i was press for time. plus im against privately own atms that charge fees.... by the time i got home food was dead cold  so i heated and wasnt to impressed. took a few to learn parking. parking turn out to be better then i read from past feedbacks. i never saw dinning area .my likes and dis likesso i like parking,like quick pick up side door,people were nice i could tell dough from pizza greatmy dislikes no credit cards, lamb was mostly fat non chew chunks. prices on line didnt seem to match on a few things i got. the tips were a bit better.pizza only one size,,i may give it a second try but next time i will hit the dining room and eat there while hot and see what else. hoping next visit will be 5 star or i look else where.  thank you."

MIJA Cantina & Tequila Bar,5,"i attended a private event here and was impressed by the extremely competent waitstaff and glowy ambiance. its hard to go wrong with an open bar, but it seemed like the designated cocktail slingers knew their way around a shaker. the passed apps were scrumptious, and although i was too busy schmoozing to sit down story of my life, the banquettes looked super comfy. pro tip if you sign up for the website mailing list, you get 10 off your next visit!"

Bailey & Sage,5,"bww is my husband and 3 year olds favorite place to eat. my son can easily record his order and the servers are so kind to him. they charge extra for refills on kids milk which is silly because soda refills are free... the adult drinks are higher priced but they have a lot of selection and two sizes. the variety of sauces and rubs is amazing! and they usually have a limited time special flavor each month, so good! you can ask to test any flavor and theyll bring you a sample and a couple fries great idea if you want to try something new but not sure you can handle the heat im a vegetarian and they have a great black bean burger, you can substitute it into any burger for no cost or create your own. if you get a burger that usually has bacon, best be safe and mention to keep it off... over all great place! lots of space, weve always had fantastic service. our last visit with alycia i believe was how she spelled her name was amazing shes so on top of her game!"

El Peñol,5,"great restaurant! i typically dont review restaurants, however, i had such a great experience that i feel like its appropriate. my girlfriend and i grabbed dinner on a friday evening, they seated us immediately. the waiter and manager were very attentive. i had the chorizo enchiladas and wow! i havent had enchiladas like that since i was a kid. my girlfriend got the fish tacos and said they were the best fish tacos shes ever had. i definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try. my only complaint would be the chips and guac were delicious, however, i didnt think id be charged for them. not a huge deal but will definitely be returning."

McDonald's,4,"good place, a little pricey."
Legal Sea Foods,1,"im a huge fan of paulis and would go for as to say its probably my favorite sandwich place in boston!im vegetarian but there are many options to get. my favorite is the eggplant pesto sandwich that i think it perfect with the french bun. the sandwich is very filling and they do a great job of stuffing it with eggplant, pesto mayo and feta. i also ask for chili flakes for a bit of a kick. got the home fries for breakfast and the serving size is huge.i think its much cheaper to get in person than through delivery apps so maybe worth just heading over and ordering at the store."
Suculento Restaurante,4,great seafood and superb wait staff! it has a real nice atmosphere too... perfect for romantic dates! i like how you can really tell everything on your plate is fresh too. very impressive. its pricy but you feel like your getting your monies worth. will definitely be back soon.
Fill-A-Buster Luncheonette,4,"maybe more like a three and a half, honestly.the food selection is all over the place, but the quality is pretty high. the beer selection was similarly scattered but had some great choices. my wife loved their oysters though.my biggest gripe is the service. the bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable, but the thing they were fastest at was dropping off a new bill when you ordered something. empty water glasses and people ready to order were second fiddle for sure."

Bleacher Bar,5,"i love love love that clover is one of the few places in all of boston that offers a vegan egg alternative sandwich. and the fact that it is a vegetarian place to eat anyways. not that you would eat this for nutrition value but to not exclude people from catered business meetings for example. great option for the trending vegan movement. also the vegan blubbery carrot muffin is to die for! so flavorful and delicious with crunchy baked oats on top, highly recommend it."

The Capital Burger,5,"theyre not the best coffee. i know people love it, but it just tastes burnt to me. good location tho, epecially for a quick emergency cup of coffee. local, who took my little grandson to fanuil hall for lunch and took a rest on the nearby benches. starbucks staff are welcoming and professional, in any i have ever been to. this, like other locations, was clean, neat, and bright."

Uni,5,great sound. easy access. easy parking.
Longwood Grille & Bar,1,"rude people except for 1 or 2 girls. they wont give u a regular styrofoam cup. i asked for a ice macchiato and it looks like they only put 1 shot of espresso in. this happened last time i came as well. ive worked at dunkin donuts, i know how a macchiato shld look and taste. especially since i get 2 a day. if im paying almost 5 dollars for a coffee i expect it to be made right. this dunks is below subpar."

My Thai Vegan Cafe,5,"despite the fact that most of the pizza at this establishment is pretty decent, the customer service that i experienced on several occasions was extremely horrible. the young indian or middle eastern guy who works as the cashier was very nice the first couple of times i bought food, but his attitudedemeanor became very negative towards me. one night i ordered a tomato and pesto slice as i thought it would be a healthy alternative to some of their other slices and it sounded good, but to my surprise it tasted very weird and had no flavor. i complained to the young guy who works in the front, and he told me we normally do not take food back and wont do so in the future, but i can give you another slice this time. i have never heard of a restaurant that will not accommodate its customers when they are unsatisfied with the food. he also just had too much attitude in his tone as he made his comment. nonetheless, i did not hold his poor professionalism against the company and went back a few times thereafter. but, i stopped going there for awhile, almost 5 months, because i moved out of the area. however, i was in boston the other night and decided to get pizza from them. the young guy took my order and loudly said because i ordered a 5 cheese slice if you dont like it, then that is on you because we are not taking it back. that will be the last time i purchase anything from crispy dough. im tired of supporting businesses and groups of people who think they can talk to customers anyhow and who do not support the communities they do business in."
Four Winds,5,way to small and greasey

Tiger Mama,5,"are you vegetarian? genki ya states on their website that they are committed to providing the healthiest and highest quality sushi. dine here confident that you will be consuming safe organic sushi. their menu even states what is or isnt organic! if you hesitate going out to dinner with friends and family because of a limited menu, try this joint. their menu provides a wide variety of vegetarian appetizers and maki rolls to enable you a dynamic dining experience. i especially recommend the vege combo vege comdo on the menu. for 18.95, you get a vege dragon roll, sweet potato roll, and avocadocucumber roll with miso soup included.  there are two dining areas split between the main floor and second story. the second story has a bar and traditional seating, though stairs seem to be the only access to the second story. the main floor has a sushi bar as well as traditional seating. the restaurant is well let and clean including the restrooms. parking at genki ya is a beast. be prepared to spend fifteen minutes driving around looking for a free spot on the side of the road. i recommend parking a distance from the restaurant and walking the rest of the way. however, the restaurant is ideally located next to the theater district. grab a quick bite before or after the show."
Globe Bar & Cafe,5,"ive been coming to this place for years. never imonce this place disappoint me! most of the time, i would order the same thing, but whenever i decided to order something different, its always good!"
Boston Burger Co-Boylston,4,best general gau chicken ive had in a long time. actually spicy.

7 Nana Japanese Steakhouse,5,"this place is ok, they have one side thats strictly seafood and one side thats strictly italian. i havent tried the italian side yet but went to the seafood side and we got right in. we both got the lobster roll and one clam chowder. the food was good but ive definitely had better lobster rolls before. also the price was very high for 2 lobster rolls and one chowder. would probably not go back to the seafood side but would give the italian side a a shot."

OliToki,4,great franchise..never disappoints
Deb's Diner,5,we got there about 40 minutes before our reservation and they were happy to seat us which was great. we ordered wine bruschetta and entrees. all came out super fast and ontop of each other which wasnt great. my shiraz tasted as if it had been there a couple of days and was only offered more at the end of our meal. the place got really busy quick so we are not sure if they were just trying to turn the tables over. our food was ok at best bruschetta was drowning in balsamic vinegar and pasta dishes lacked flavour and hard shell clams were bitter. i would like to chalk it up to they were busy since they were. but there are so many other italian restaurants in the area i will try a different one next time.
Uno Due Go,4,good place but a little pricy for cafeteria style dining.

Mezcala Tex Mex Grill,3,"my mother and i stopped here for lunch today. place was clean, service was excellent, food was just okay, they did not serve bread with meal. the salad that came with the meal lacked dressing of any kind. we would not be back and i would not suggest this place to eat with so many other places to eat in the area."
Fresh City,4,the food here is great and the servers are very polite and generous all the time.
Barracuda Tavern,2,"nachos overdone, generally much better. maybe the chef wasnt on top of hisher game."
7 Chinese Restaurant,5,get the sandwiches
Uno Due Go,5,"nice looking restaurant with a menu that shows an amplitude range of delicious but pricey plates. when i went there on a sunday night the restaurant only had two waiters and because of that i had to get up and look for our waiter twice. we had the octopus and the ny strip, they were very good. for two i think 3 small plates would be a better option. is a good restaurant but in that range of prices you can find better options in boston."

Olive Garden,3,"anyone that rates this below a 5star or says that there are better soup dumplings in boston are just flat out wrong. the soup dumplings were delicious. they had great flavor. we also ordered chicken fried rice, which was light and had a good flavor.the service was a little slow, but well worth it for those dumplings."
Scola's Café,5,"absolutely awful food. i had the shrimp tacos, which were an unqualified disaster. there was no shrimp in the shrimp. just nasty oilsaturated breading with soppy cabbage and flavorless sauces on stale corn tortillas. even the black beans served on the side were a failure. how?the beer i ordered with my food was flat and tasted like dirty tap lines.i sensed when i walked in that things werent up to snuff. the place smells gross and the staff seems unhappy. how this place continues to exist is a mystery."
Blue Elephant Restaurant,4,"jaes always pleases. udon noodles with szechuan sauce its amazing. in my last visit the staff have me a free dessert because she thought the chicken satay was cooked to much. i didnt ask for anything, she just vastness over and offered dessert on the house.jaes always keeps knee coming back."

Saigon Hut,5,"delicious brunch, great service. dont know what the negative reviews are about."
Rodey Pizzeria & Pasta,2,"the pizza at picco is baked to perfection!  the crust, slightly charred to add a bit of crunch to the soft, chewy dough, makes each bite of pie ohso tasty.  the beer list includes all craft brews and constantly changes ensuring something for everyone.  not just a pizza place, piccos menu includes starters, soups, salads, sandwiches, and pasta.  their meatball sandwich is my favorite meatball sandwich around.  did i mention dessert?  picco makes all the ice creams on their dessert list and they are a definite must, so leave room.  with flavors like mint chip, coffee, coconut chip, honey, dark chocolate, and more, you, once again, will not be disappointed.  reservations accepted only for parties of eight or more so be prepared for a wait if you go at peak dining times."
Caffè dello Sport,5,"the lunch cheeks tray for 16 is a very good deal and a filling meal at lunchtime. both the pulled pork and the pulled chicken are surprisingly juicy, which is a rarity at barbecue restaurants, where particularly pulled chicken is often dry. i suspect they were both hit with a little sauce before serving, but i cant complain with results. speaking of sauces, skip the house barbecue sauce and opt for the carolina vinegar sauce, which compliments both the pork and chicken. theres also a habanero vinegar sauce that isnt quite as spicy as they lead you to believe. unfortunately, the ribs were very tender but flavorless. the broccoli cheese casserole isnt much to look at, but its a good choice if you like broccoli and cheese. theres also a good selection of craft beer in cans and bottles in addition to the six taps."
Cask 'n Flagon,5,"the food here is amazing, and the people were incredible, friendly, and knowledgeable."
South End Pita,5,if you like roaches in your food this is the place to go. absolutely disgusting

Atlantic Fish Co,4,"this was our goto spot for a treatyourself meal when i was an emerson college student. prices are not overly expensive, but theyre a little above what a college student likes to pay on average. its worth the  though because the food is great! the corned beef hash at brunch is amazing, and the burgers are good as well. the potato wedges are always crispy! and i could write poetry about the graham cracker smores dessert..."

Fin Point Oyster Bar + Grille,5,this little place is deceiving. i almost dismissed it because of how crowded and cramped it looked. but... there is a reason for that as i was soon to find out. i ordered 4 types of dumplings. the flavors exploded in my mouth! good ingredients and expertly done dumplings. definitely try it. it is a very popular place because it is pure dumpling deliciousness.

Stash's Pizza,5,a hidden gem in fanueil hall! they serve pitchers of margaritas and the kitchen is open until 1am. the food and alcohol offerings are vast and well priced for the area.

Max Brenner,5,"fantastic food and drinks, takes forever to get a table"
Crispy Dough Pizzeria,4,if youre going to get a quick bite to eat to know the better place to mcdonalds
Little Caesars Pizza,4,"very quick service. mac and cheese is by far the best side. still the same as i remember growing up. apples are great too. quarter white chicken with 3 sides, cornbread and large drink will run you about 12 and change. throw a brownie in and its another dollar or so. so theres good value. chicken is moist and hot, but needed some salt. corn was good, but again needed salt in my opinion. overall, its a good value"
McDonald's,5,restrooms are terrible.  staff is good though.
Zo Greek Cuisine,5,delicious food! buy a bottle of their hot sauce.
CAVA,5,"this was a very nice restaurantbakery in lower mills, dorchester. it has a nice ambiance coupled with really good food. the sunday brunch is very good, and their baked goods are a treat on your way out."

Restaurante Montecristo,5,"great food, reasonably priced."
P & R Restaurant,5,"this is my goto brunchbreakfast spot in boston. the food is made fresh right in front of you for instance the homefries are cut from a potato as you watch. you stand in line to order then you sit down  it may look really busy sometimes, but i have never had to wait for a table once my food was ready. they have the best omelets and french toast!"
Quattro,5,the food is great!
Pat's Place,5,"ipad menus are a snazzy idea, but if youre going to share pictures of your food it should approximate what will actually be brought to the table. the guacamole and salsas were excellent, but the mole that i ordered  which, on the menu, was a rich, dark sauce  was a mild yellow sauce. i might not have minded, had i not seen an image of the exact dish i was in the mood for prior to ordering.if your friends insist on the waterfront for, you know, the water, this is the best option snag a bar table, stick to the appetizers and go for the sangria. if you want a better margarita, equally delicious guacamole and entrees that live up to their description for less money, head inbound a bit on summer street."
KT Grill,4,good i little smaller then other sports center but its good
Five Guys,5,normally a big fan but i was extremely disappointed i the service today.  i was left to wait for 30 minutes after my reservation so they could clean the table. it was only after 20 minutes that the staff fessed up to the truth. it seems they forgot about our simply didnt care enough to honor our reservation. i would have preferred if they were upfront about the delay.

Tremont 647,4,"a quiet relaxing upscale restaurant in chinatown. only an eight minute walk to the emerson colonial theater. the shrimp and walnuts, oxtail chow foon and moo shu duck were all excellent. the plum cocktail was good. especially nice ambience with good music at a comfortable volume. the staff is very friendly and efficient. i will definitely return and this is something i cant say about most restaurants in the theater district."
Garlic 'n Lemons,4,great selection and good drinks.
Cafe Quattro,5,like home cooked meals.
Jade Pacific,3,delicious variety of sea food. visited it more than once!
Erbaluce,4,"this place is horrible, poorly organized, and mismanaged. i booked a table hear for my birthday for 6 people. granted i know that its a bar at night time and we wouldnt be sitting for the whole night but you at least provide the option for people to sit. the table was a couch that could fit max 4 people. and then half way through the night they sold half our table off to another group of people so i had to sit on this small couch next to an obnoxious horrible smelling stranger. the whole experience was awful. it took 15 minutes for anyone to bring us to our table, their decoration was just a plain piece of paper with my name written in marker, the bottle service girl told me i had to spend 350 despite me booking a 300 table, and the bottle service girl was attending to multiple tables and would walk away and take my bottle with her to other tables. i had to call at least six times to get in touch with management who was rude and unapologetic. it took me two weeks to get a measly refund of 50. i had to call multiple times to make sure they were actually processing it because they had forgotten to do it a week after agreeing to it.  im baffled at how horribly they handled this."
"The White Bull Tavern | Boston's Best Comedy, Nightclub, Restaurant",5,roti rocks.
Villa Mexico Cafe,4,"i love this place!! its just like im in a restaurant right in ponce, p.r.. the most amazing puerto rican food ive ever had.  the portions are perfect for me to have some left over to bring home. and the service... wow! our waiter miguelitowas so charismatic and so courteous and helpful, made me proud of my ponceos. i loved this place so much im going back today. cant wait to try something else from their menu. pictures to be posted soon. "
Fuji at Ink Block,1,excellent beer list. had two trilliums on tap. had a sip of my girlfriends bloody mary and it made me jealous.

Fasika Cafe,5,great brunch on weekends
Red Lantern Restaurant & Lounge,1,"i bought a vegetable and rice combo for 10 which in my opinion is very overpriced. the vegetables were steamed and barely seasoned if at all. if it was priced more reasonably maybe id give them an extra star, but you can get better food at that price within the food court."
Tawakal Halal Cafe,5,great food and great customer service.i will definitely be going back.loved the atmosphere.
Regina Pizzeria,5,"had 2 wait 15 minutes 2 place and receive my order.  one of the fresh, round, full egg on sausage, egg, cheese mcmufdin had pieces of eggshell in it!!  "
The Daily Catch Waterfront,4,never going back here again.  ordered two number sevens two drumsticks and a thigh plus two sodas with no ice.  confirmed the order multiple times in the drive through.  we received a bag of iced tea which was clearly not what we ordered and two thighs one drumstick and no biscuits.  we realized the order was wrong right away and honked my horn multiple times to try to get the attention of an employee and we were ignored.  we were ripped off by this establishment and ignored.
IHOP,5,new orleans and cajun themed menu.  excellent for brunch.  great atmosphere and great service.
Maggiano's Little Italy,4,"blue collar pizza joint. good pizza, house of pizza  greek style. salads are prepared with dressing on the side. i ordered a caesars and it was good. when you gotta have the normal this it."

Back Deck,5,eww
Clover Food Lab,4,"nice joint. pricey, but nice...."
Loretta's Last Call,1,"a two hundred dollar disappointment for two. three stars is generous and only because the kitchen did a good job preparing the food. my friend and i had high expectations based on reviews and word of mouth, but it ended up being a on overpriced and unpleasant experience. although it was a saturday night, the place surprisingly was not very busy. yet our server was confused all night. he could not manage to keep a table of two straight and mixed up our drinks, then our salads, and then our entrees. and while some guests may enjoy having a bartender wheel a cart to your table and narrate the making of your drinks, i find nothing amazing about itive seen a thousand bartenders make me a drink. its a gimmick and a fiveminute distraction from the people you are dining with. i ordered a second cocktail but the waiter again got the order wrong and had the bar make the drink my friend had for his first cocktail. a solid 10 minutes later he returned, with the same drink and apologized that the bar was backed up and did i want this wrong drink while i waited. another 10 minutes passed and another staff person came by and apologized again that the bar was backed up.  a full 25 minutes later my drink arrived. what can you do but shake your head? was it complimentary? nope. the food was good, well prepared and presented, though the portions were small and the prices steep. in the end, any other place in the seaport or south end would have been a better choice."
Stephanie's,4,everything was great. the staff was on point. i had the happy hour tacos with some truffle fries. the happy hour menu is a bit pricey still. there are plenty of other happy hour foods around there if youre looking for something cheaper.
Bistro du Midi,3,"good selection of sushi and rice dishes, as well as delicious drinks"
China Pearl Restaurant,5,cheese fries are addicting.
Sudbury Pizza Place,4,went there for the first time and loved it
Dunkin,4,"this is my spot i dont care about the line. i dont care its cold ill wait. the smell alone get me hungry. once inside this small quant haven blooms with mouth watering eat me smells. the food fills not just your mouth but your senses as well. the crunchy veggies, soft pita and juicy rotisserie beef lamb and chicken and the sauces spicy but not overwhelmingly hot it all makes u want another and another. then theres the dessert lightly sweet warm almost like donut holes but better. theres so much more tasty goodness to eat here thats why i keep going back"
Mamma Maria,3,found hair in my food... yummy!

Soup Shack JP,5,"a two hundred dollar disappointment for two. three stars is generous and only because the kitchen did a good job preparing the food. my friend and i had high expectations based on reviews and word of mouth, but it ended up being a on overpriced and unpleasant experience. although it was a saturday night, the place surprisingly was not very busy. yet our server was confused all night. he could not manage to keep a table of two straight and mixed up our drinks, then our salads, and then our entrees. and while some guests may enjoy having a bartender wheel a cart to your table and narrate the making of your drinks, i find nothing amazing about itive seen a thousand bartenders make me a drink. its a gimmick and a fiveminute distraction from the people you are dining with. i ordered a second cocktail but the waiter again got the order wrong and had the bar make the drink my friend had for his first cocktail. a solid 10 minutes later he returned, with the same drink and apologized that the bar was backed up and did i want this wrong drink while i waited. another 10 minutes passed and another staff person came by and apologized again that the bar was backed up.  a full 25 minutes later my drink arrived. what can you do but shake your head? was it complimentary? nope. the food was good, well prepared and presented, though the portions were small and the prices steep. in the end, any other place in the seaport or south end would have been a better choice."

The Paramount,5,"i went to this restaurant because the boston university huntington theatre co has a preshow reception for invisible man on jan 11, 2013.  we had our own private room in the back.  it fits about 30 people standing room only.  the restaurant provided free appetizer for the attendee, maybe the huntington had to pay for it and provided a cash bar.  they had about 8 different types of beers on tap, the drink range from 68, and mixed drink is around 10.  the appetizers were onion ring, guacamole and chip, and minitacos.   the food kept coming.  one thing i would suggest is to get a fork to eat the bed of lettuce and tomatoes the minitaco it came on.   it is tasty and nutritious!we can still order one of its many types of burgers.  the beef patties were thick and juicy. they even had japanese sushi.   two wait staff took care of us and each of us had paid with individual checks, so they really had great memories.everything was easy about this event, it is easy to find, there are parking garages nearby, and order and paying were quick.  if i was going to host a party, i would definitely consider this place."

Jade Pacific,5,"wendys used to be my favorite fast food chain from 3 burger options. recently went to the drive thru of this specific wendys. 20 minute wait to get to the order window, no ordering ahead and when i finally got my order, i specifically asked if there were straws in the bag, and the person having me my order replied yes and then when we drove off and opened the bag, no straws, no sauces for the fries,they gave us a dr pepper instead of a diet coke and one sandwich was missing. i know that its not really wendys fault, but that experience made me to not want to go to any wendys ever again. and even before the pandemic, this place used to be slow at the drive thru, but after this... wendys no more for me.update after ordering through grubhub a few timesevery time i preorder wendys they are late. like at least half an hour late. the whole point of the preorder is so your order gets there first thing so it can be on time. if you go to their drive thru, you have to make sure you preorder on the app and choose the curbside because if you get there and their drive thru has more than 5 cars very frequent, you are looking at 20 minutes wait minim. also they only have 2 spots for pickup and last time i was there, a couple was sitting in their car eating their order without changing space..those are only pickup spots and with only 2 you might get there and not have anywhere to park to get your order. now the couple waiting was not wendys fault..but only 2 spots? all they have to do is make signs for 2 more right next to them in case other idiots decide to stay in that spot and eat without moving first. slow service, frequently mix up orders, the only thing keeping that place open is that they are the only wendys around for miles!i keep giving them a chance cause occasionally im in the mood for wendys..especially since you eat the same drive thru every time during covid...every drive thru has upped their game with covid..not wendys in norwood"

Dirty Water Dough Company,5,"we tried again because paani used to be our favorite restaurant.  we went there for birthdays and special occasions.  after our initial experiences in their sudbury location, see below  that rating was one star  we hadnt been back in over a year.  tonight we tried again takeout.  first the soup.   we had mulligatawny and the coconut tomato.  and what we had  of it it comes in 4oz quantities we could have done without.  unremarkable, salty, watery 1.50 per ounce.  i recommend skipping the experience.  considering that the  best mulligatawny i ever had was at paani years ago disappointing.the lamb samosas were lovely, crisp and  well seasoned.  if you have to be at panni, have these.  the railway goat curry had a nice flavor, but was very fatty, and what could be discerned of actual goat meat was very slight and overwhelmed by bones, gristle and fat.  nice flavor, but i dont feel better having eaten it.the chili mushroom appetizer  could have provided the oil for the whole meal.  the first taste was interesting, but the flavors were kind of odd and with the heaviness, i ended up not finishing it.  the naan  we had the onioncoriander one  was about what you would expect, also a little heavy and on the  doughy side.  all in all, not horrible, but also not a meal i would repeat.  upping my one star to two.from over a year ago i  have to agree with boris.  severely disappointed with my first experience at the new paani.  tonight we ordered takeout.  two of the 6 things we ordered were not right and the flavor was lacking in everything.  they substituted tandoori chicken for the chicken tikka we requested and paneer pakoras for the onion bhaji we ordered without any notification to us  neither had much flavor and both were rather dry.  also, i had looked forward to the soup i remembered from the old location.  tonights mulligatawny soup was too salty and simply not as flavorful as i had remembered.  the lamb samosas were dry and had no peas, or any vegetable.  the chicken tikka masala was okay, but not particularly good.  paani used to be our favorite indian place in all of the greater boston area.  not this paani."

Lady M Cake Boutique,5,"we had a great experience at pabu, ordering the sunday omakase.  the service and atmosphere were amazing, and i guess its not super busy on sunday because we practically had the place to ourselves.  the food was great, but not amazing.  the happy oyster might be wrong and the tofu with strawberries were really interesting courses, and i enjoyed them a lot!  the chicken skewers and spicy tuna roll, while delicious, were nothing too surprising.   from the other reviews, their omakase changes frequently, so i would definitely come back at some point."

Imperial Buffet,5,"cozy and delicious small italian restaurant right in the heart of the dessert hub. the menu does not have too much variety, although you can ask for several of the dishes to be made dairy free or vegan. the portions are normal to the smaller side, but are packed in flavor.normally it is difficult to get a table to eat here, so its best to order a reservation or waltz in with a stroke of luck. although the wait staff is accommodating, they are not that attentive nor hospitable enough for a restaurant environment."

Legal Sea Foods - Downtown Crossing,5,the bagels were enjoyable...light and airy not what im typically accustomed to from nyc. i will definitely return and try something from the sandwich menu. i feel the bagels would be great for sandwiches. the coffee cake was excellent.

Gyro City,5,"i really wanted to love this place and i do think its good but it just cant get 5 stars....why? well,it was down to the experience and that was down  to the staff.we brought our 10 year old here for her birthday with her 12 year old sister. i had built up the restaurant and was so excited. we came in and the front of staff was great. very warm and friendly.we were placed at a table on the outside of the inner circle and waited for our server timeliness was not the issue. it was when she walked up, we were all excited about this unique restaurant, you could tell she just wanted to get through the day. so our excitement was slowly diminished as lunch went on with our drip of a waitress.the food was good but not incredible. it felt like you could get it anywhere  like the friendly toast. it didnt exceed expectations and i could have pushed this to a 5 had it been really good. but the food was just good not great and the staff was ok not good so heres where we are. the cups for the hot chocolate were great though and we bought 2 of those in the shop.also, just a note, it was a birthday lunch and nothing was done to make my daughter feel special. i booked it and told the hostess. a birthday hot chocolate or a cupcake with a candle could have been nice, but maybe this is done on purpose to get you to do the dessert.we probably wont trek into town again to go here for lunch. and we probably wouldnt come back if i was in the area."
Atlantic Fish Co,5,"the falafels are crisp and flavorful. try a little bit if everything  especially the beets, beans and hummus. and, oh please, add the spicy sauce!"

Cósmica,1,"i called and placed an order on a sunday afternoon. the guy confirmed my order by repeating it back to me and then said, 15 minutes. i got there and no one had a clue. everyone was doing the blame game only to find out that the guy who was taking phone calls never shared my order with the chef. i had to wait twenty extra minutes for my order. my family members were waiting in the car. i was too disappointed. anyway......got it home. opened it and saw that the chicken tenders werent tender at all! they were dry and over cooked and close to burnt and the fries were brick sticks! they were crunching like crunchy granola. the specialty pizza i ordered was pretty good but it was saltier than i like it. this was 2 sundays ago, if im not mistaken. it was horrible. my family couldnt eat it and we didnt get to eat together because i had lost time dealing with stashs. i had to run to work with a salty piece of pizza. mind you they never gave a discount for the inconvenience of having me wait extra time for them to figure out why my order was not made. the bill was about 40 for a late, salty, dry, over cooked, tough, and overall bad experience. nothankyou iwillcookathome"
Larry J's BBQ Cafe,5,"awesome food, great fries and amazing milkshakes. my girlfriend mistakingly did not order a combo when she thought she did. a worker named jose pointed out how we ordered wrong and proceeded to bring us out a huge serving of fries to make up for it. the staff were super friendly and i really appreciated jose went out of his way even after we told him not to worry about it."

BOSTON RD PIZZA,5,"this place was amazing, went for lunch with some coworkers and wasnt displeased.  firstly can i saw their calamari had the tentacles...  youd think it would be a more common thing seeing that its a normal part to the squids body but apparently uncultured tubes are dissuaded by the small appendages.  the beer, omg they had true north ales gold winning vincianne they beat belgium in their own beer style, truly a great beer for a great meal.  and finally the sandwich...  they had a croque monsieur . it has been truly difficult to find one let alone a good one the boston area and it was perfect, the brioche was a clearly winning bread to place the ham and grueyre between, nice and crunchy where the sauce didnt touch and quickbroiled to perfection.  im certainly coming back, and hopefully soon."

Big Apple Restaurant,4,"i visited boston in hopes of enjoying some french food and this restaurant seemed to get a lot of good press. after trying it for myself i now realize they must be paying for the publicity. this is only one link in a chain of restautants owned by seth woods. a good rule of thumb is when you see the name of the restaurant youre eating on your own dinner plate, avoid it.the cocktail and wine list are lovely but the food was a joke.for an appetizer i tried the lobster bisque and it was 13 chive oil and totally disgusting. the escargot was fine but then again i am not sure if ant restaurant is truly capable of screwing up snails in garlic butter.for entrees the pan roasted rohan duck breast was good but the quartersized seared scallop entree allegedly served with vegetables and an inedible fennel salad was a scoff. the scallops were cooked perfectly but there was no cohesiveness to this dish. by the time the server who shall not be named because she never bothered to introduce herself strolled back to my table inquiring if we liked our selections we had obviously eaten the scallops leaving the vegetable nonsense for the birds.she cut me off a few times to answer a question with the same question i was asking in a condescending tone so i cut the dinner before dessert and i wont be returning. au revoir!!!"

Chinese Dragon,5,"i went vegan 1 12 yrs ago.  since then it has been difficult to find places to eat where the whole family would be satisfied.finally, we found this awesome place.  not only did the staff and chef accommodate me but they took it one extra step and called the owner just to assure no mistakes were made when making suggestions to serve me. portions are enormous,  the food is delicious , the environment is clean,  and the ambiance is pleasant.expect to pay for parking in the north end or you can take the train.  either way you will not be disappointed."

Boston Burger Company,4,"hours on google maps are wrong. i swung by to check this place out based on my roommates recommendation, but found a closed sign out front. they also did not post updated hours out front, so i dont know if theyre closing earlier than what google maps says or if theyre just temporarily closed. ive noticed quite a few places are doing this  pretty frustrating, its not hard to update a google maps page. takes 5 minutes to post correct hoursclosuresetc."

Longwood Grille & Bar,5,"the only reason i gave this place 35 is the fact that i had to wait for almost 2 hours to get a table. though now i know to book a table in advance so as to avoid the long queues especially for sunday brunch. i hope next time, my experience will be worth  55"
Rod Thai Family Taste,5,"if i could give zero stars i would because 1 is too generous. the girl who took out order by phone was extremely rude and unprofessional. my manager ordered from there 2x today. earlier she ordered her n a coworker lunch and tonight she ordered food for a group of kids at work and when my manager called back to ask that she included cups and.plates bc of the large order which included 2 two liter sodas, the staff member i mentioned was rude and nasty and hung up on my manager who kept trying to call back but the girl kept hanging up on her and eventually refused to answer again."
Empire,5,"similar experience to others noted here. excellent experience the first timegreat food, trendyindustrial decor, good service, and delicious drinks. i enjoyed the lasagna and loved the arancini great marinara.during our second visit, it became apparent that space is an issue, as we were constantly bumped by servers, other guests, and had to place our belongings beneath the table. the temperature in the restaurant was very warm and it became stuffy quickly, to the point where we wished we hadnt ordered our drinks so that we could exit. we stayed and unfortunately, policy appeared to change and when we tried to order an appetizer while we decided, we were told we had to order our entrees at the same time. throughout the evening, we felt very rusheduntil we wanted to pay and that took entirely too long.perhaps it was just a tough evening there. the food remains delicious, though pricey considering portions. id likely go back to sit at the small bar and enjoy appetizers, but the dining room needs to address some space issues."
Bin 26 Enoteca,5,always fun for a group dinner. i feel like portions have gotten smaller over the years though.

Trattoria Il Panino,5,"delicious food with a friendly staff. when i first entered i was confused as to the seating situation and worried that we wouldnt be able to find a spot in the small diner. as the line progressed a perfect two person table opened up for me and my girlfriend. it was only then i noticed the sign that talked about their seating policy, stating that they ask you get your food before sitting down, which helps the turnover of tables go more smoothly. lo and behold the system worked perfectly, and the food came out quickly. coffee was sub par though."
Supreme Pizza,3,"pleasantly hopeful after 10 years. awesome waitress, but disappointed with the food, menu selection only one leafy salad, had the meatloaf, which was no bell ringer, and the dessert pumpkin pie,  was common. underwhelmed, wont go back to sit in uncomfortable bistro chairs. im a big guy, 61, 225."

Olympic House of Pizza,5,"place is nice and clean. staff are nice and helpful! i had a steak taco salad and a a burrito. the salad is kinda disappointing with just little bit of steak wish there was more, especially that it was more expensive than other type of meat and the dressing was boring and didnt taste special. the burrito was okay, though i had to pay for guac and extra sour cream, and im not sure it was worth it. they also have a small salsa bar which was cool!it wasnt too bad of an experience."

Frenchie Wine Bistro,5,the food is amazing and its a great spot..
Aceituna Grill,5,this place has a very nice atmosphere its very peaceful and a prefect place to study. ive only tried the lavender and the avocado flavors and in my opinion it starts out tasting like the actual flavor but theres always a coconut aftertaste. makes sense because they use coconut milk as a base but it could be overwhelming sometimes.

Tavern Road,5,"the redhatter, variable price, variable alcohol content."
Bacco Ristorante & Bar,5,"great pasta dishes and a large menu. the service, while friendly, was very slow, particularly when it came to refilling drinks or bringing the bill at the end of the meal. we visited during the lunch hour when it was quite busy, which resulted in a high noise level, but not so much that it made conversation overly difficult. italian food lovers will find a lot to enjoy here."
Globe Bar & Cafe,5,great food and service! we went there for my birthday and it was fantastic!

Hojoko,5,excellent potato soup as well as delicious pizza.
BOSTON RD PIZZA,4,"cool interior and excellent drinks. pretty great burger though the one drawback is that they dont serve fries. the potatoes they serve are like wellseasoned home fries, which are good but not exactly what id like with a burger. the burger is highly customizable with a variety of cheeses and other topping options. the brioche bun is a little too substantial for my liking but its pretty great overall.the sandwiches are also good here, as are the tacos and the brunch options. the eggplant appetizer is also good. this place is a nice option just outside the kenmorefenway periphery, but can still get busy before games and events."

Spyce,3,"translated by google i love this pizza without a doubt i think it is the best because of the cheese, its dough, the flavor, the sauce, how it is cooked and how it reaches the palateoriginalme encata esta pizza sin duda creo que es la mejor por el queso  su masa el sabor la salsa como esta cocinada y como llega al paladar"
Wollaston's Market,5,lovely in summer in backyard.
Maxine's On Saint James,5,"first time at any wagamama, this one was beyond packed but the chefs were on top of it. i personally got the katsu curry because o knew id like it, which of course they delivered and then some. the salad i could do with or without though. the rest of my party got ramen and loved every second of it. also the server did say you ran out of elderberry, for the elderberry and ginger, but the bartender suggested something he came up with but wasnt sure how it would taste. it tasted delicious and i would definitely put it on the menu!"
Asian Garden Restaurant,4,place is good but quite expensive. service could be improved.
The Chicken & Rice Guys,5,"great food   but the fact that there are not free refills on soda, i have to give this place 1 star. absolutely ridiculous  makes me consider other ways thats this restaurant might be cheating customers that arent as visible, such as cleanliness or benefits."

"Explorateur Cafe, Restaurant & Bar",5,good food..even better customer service
Ocean Prime,4,this place is always out of everything. the name is panera bread and somehow i dont understand how they can be out of bread. last weekend we went and asked for egg souffles they said they were out and it takes 20 mins to cook new ones. we said we would go run an errand and come back.. they seemed surprised by that answer and responded with hold on let me check if we can.... umm yeah no. sorry so this weekend we asked for souffles they were again out so we asked for simple egg and cheese on everything bagels.. they were out of everything bagels. we went with plain and upon returning home we noticed they were bagels with just cheese. they forgot the egg? will not be giving this place a third chance.
Beijing Cafe,5,"amazing place , nice people.  friendly environment."
Yankee Lobster,5,very good food with huge portions! i would definitely come back here
Trade,5,great greeters and servers! interesting but limited menu. i was in the mood for a burger anyway so that was cool.
KO Catering and Pies,5,"not the sophisticated dinner and experience i expected. first impressions were poor, as server was dirty, in an old black shirt, greasy hair. drinks arrived 45 minutes from when we sat down. tabletop is worn, and the napkins are bar rags, supposed to be casual but are just cheap. food was okay, portions are really small, which is nice for japanese food, but as the dishes arrive sort of in a haphazard fashion the meal lacks the charming discipline of a true izakaya. this style of restaurant with the small plates and offhand service is getting tired."
Starbucks,4,was so good
Rodey Pizzeria & Pasta,3,translated by google i invite you to the town 2 it is a good meal i do not know good they are not going to repentoriginallos invito a al pueblo 2es una buena comida no se buen no se ban a repentir

Lambert's Marketplace,5,a gluten free pizza. they take their precautions to be sure theres no cross contamination
Sprout Mediterranean Inspired Salads,5,good branch.
UBURGER,3,"outstanding! best burger that i have had in a very long time. make sure you ask for the maple mayo sauce to dip your fries, you will not be disappointed!my burger had fried pickles on it. i do wish that they were smaller pickles or sliced against the grain so it would have been easier to bite without creating a mess."

BFC: Boston Fried Chicken And Burritos,5,"food wasnt great, portions are massive like, too massive, and its basically a place for drunk college kids to go when they get the munchies so they quality doesnt have to be great."
Lucia Ristorante,5,"went here with my coworkers on a thursday night after work. we opted to do the hibachi menu. we had great service. they took our orders quickly and were very friendly. we didnt order any specialty drinks, just waters, but the water we got was a nice quality. the food was fantastic. i enjoyed the mushroom soup at the start of the meal it had very good flavor but was light  refreshing. i did not eat the salad, but my coworkers enjoyed theirs. once we had finished our soups and salads, the chef came over and started the show. standard hibachi flare, with the tricks and the flames, but still very well done. everything was cooked perfectly nothing burnt and nothing underdone. were all leaving with happy  full bellies...and some leftovers for later!"
Nebo Cucina & Enoteca,4,this place is clean and delicious. we are not much into chinese food but loved this place in the middle of nowhere.

Paradise Biryani Pointe,4,"kind service and quality ingredients. sometimes there is a line and the quality of my burritotaco slips in the lunchtime chaos, but for the most part, this qdoba is great. i love the new knockout tacos, and that avocado is available for no extra charge."

Country Kitchen,4,"their biscuits and creamy and soft whipped honey butter are the best! highly recommend getting the fat cheeks tray to share between two people because you get three choices of meat, one hot side, and one cold side. the fried okra is also pretty good as the appetizer to start off the meal!"
Pressed,3,sevice very slow
Ducali Pizzeria & Bar,4,"its pricey, but the service was first rate and the food was out of this world. my wife and i went during one of our yearly staycations. super atmosphere and great steaks."

North 26,3,the drinks are a must get

Fox & The Knife,5,"the scallop dish was probably the best scallops ive ever had. my wife was happy with her steak as well. however, when i asked if there was a dessert drinks menu the waiter told me there wasnt, but that if i knew what i wanted he could ask at the bar and see what they had. that was strange, but it did end up working, and i got an lbv port. it was served refrigerator levels of cold, which isnt proper for a port. they also had run out of one of their listed wines on the wine by the glass menu.service in general was too fast, i felt. we got our entrees before we were done with ours apps, and we werent dawdling over them either. plates were also cleared immediately, but person by person, which annoys me because it makes the slower eaters feel rushed."

Shawarma Falafel,5,"a small yet cozy ramen shop. tables and chairs are set up in a way where you are likely going to sit next to strangers enjoying wonderful bowls of ramen. service is good. if its busy then their seating system, which will text and call you when your table is ready, makes for a good reason to take a quick walk on newbury street. the menu is small so it is easy to pick from. if you go with ramen and you arent familiar with it, you may want to ask for the less salty version since japanese ramen can be considered very salty. you cant go wrong with any of the ramen choices on the menu."

Siano's Italian Pizzeria & Restaurant,5,server was very incredibly rude and condescending.
Boston Shawarma,4,"the food was good but the service was really lacking. i would like to have given 4 stars but we went for sunday brunch with 1230 reservations through open table. she came by 3 times  before delivering our coffee on the 4th trip after providing excuses, such as, the coffee is all the way in the back. i will say she did get us our first glass of water quickly which was critical to alleviating my hangover. the problem was i had to ask for a refill on my water, again, 3x and if she has just said she forgot it would have been better than never taking responsibility a pet peeve of mine.  the food was good, not great, and borderline for the price, esp when coupled w the service. the live band was a sublime cover, and they played well. overall, there are better options, altho this probably should have been expected given our ability to get last minute reservations on a sunday."

Cafe Artigiano,4,"really its the hostess fault. the hostess was incredibly rude to my wife. we should have just left when she behaved that way to her, but it was late and we were hungry. aside from that the food was tremendously oversalted so the bad food added insult to injury. i think the mongolian beef was the only thing that was okay, but the sides of rice just arent cooked well or perhaps it is just old rice cooked in the morning or the day before so since i was there late at night we got stale rice?. this was a few months back and i just remembered i wanted to leave this review so that your hostess are trained not to treat customers like were trash especially since were minorities, and we are well aware that we never see anglos get treated with the slightest hint of disrespect at any restuarant, and certainly not a pf changs. ive been to pf changs in stamford ct, and seattle wa, and this is the first time i had a bad experience. needless to say ill never go back."

Tora Japanese Restaurant,4,"theres a lot of south asian food in boston, but the elephant walk has some of the best in the boston area. the decor is also nice, and there is a pretty good wine selection as well. surprisingly, however, the bathroom is tiny, down a staircase, and in pretty rough condition. its so jarringly at odds with an otherwise excellent restaurant that its hard to determine what happened."

QDOBA Mexican Eats,5,"this review only pertains to my experiences with their dim sum menuwhile not my preferred place to go for dim sum, this place is growing on me. their pork buns are delicious and are, perhaps, the perfect size. not too big but not to small either. the rice dish that is tucked within a lotus leaf is also quite good, though china pearls features some king of meat within it, something i found odd since i always thought this was a vegetarian dish. a friend who has grown up on dim sum and acted as my groups culinary navigator confirmed that it doesnt usually have meat inside but can on occasion. other things that my group of six ordered shrimp dumplings, those long, flat noodles, sticky rice, pork dumplings you can tell im a dim sum expert, and those delicious sesame balls for dessert. they do have a buffet bar with other things but ive never ventured over there so i cannot stay what they havedont have.i will say that this place can be super crowded, especially if you are thinking about visiting on the weekend. plan ahead you might have to wait up to a half hour to be seated, though those tables do turner over fast. also, waiters can be hit or miss. same for the carts. you could be waiting fifteen minutes for the right cart to come by only to have it run out of food again before it reaches your table.despite the cons, this place is great, especially if you are new to dim sum or introducing it to your friends. one final thing dont come here if you are a vegetarian. one of my friends is and she could only eat maybe two dishes, both of which our dim sum navigator had to find for her. if you love meat though, come on by."

La Tapatia Taqueria,4,"we frequently dine at theos  it is reliably delicious. it is certainly cozy with just a few tables, but the long line outside can attest to its greatness. believe me, the line is worth it. and it does move quickly in this nofuss restuarant. everything is prepared in the openconcept kitchen. be warned, they use a fair amount of butter when cooking everything on the griddle. i mean, there is a butter beneath the mound of potatoes cooking. but it is amazing that way. the best potatoes ive had. the menu is elaborate, and there is something to please everyone. the sweet tooths, those who prefer a savory breakfast. my only complaint is that it is cash only. i will return here always."

Mi Pueblito Restaurant,5,"dinner reviewwhen you take a step into cornish pasty, you feel like you are taking a step into a pub in england with the long wooden bar, dim lights, and the ornate wooden booths. i immediately felt warm and welcomed here and was instantly excited for the meal. i vaguely remember them talking about pasties in harry potter so that brought back some childhood memories as well.the thing to get here, as the name of the restaurant would suggest, is a cornish pasty which is similar to a calzone or a hand pie. however, to start, my girlfriend and i shared the parliament wings which were both sweet and spicy and definitely had a lingering spice that necessitated me calling the waiter over for more water. these chicken wings were a nice start.i was between so many of the different pasties but given that i hadnt had indian food in so long and because the brits are known for good indian food, i went for the chicken tikka masala pasty. the pasty comes cut in half and filled with chunks for chicken and potatoes. the mintyogurt sauce is a perfect companion as the chicken breast is slightly on the dry side chicken thighs would be a bit moister.we also got a side of oven fries which you could tell were cut fresh and were some of the better fries ive had in the city.all this food was on the cheaper side pasties under 16 so its a great place to have a unique dining experience in boston but it wont break the bank."

Bukowski Tavern,5,i must say they have some very good breakfast is and their lunch menus are good as well especially that meatloaf with mashed potatoes i personally like the eggs and bacon and grits with the melted cheese in it but they have a wide selection of foods and the atmosphere is very nice this homely and laidback and you feel like youre actually in your own den just having something to eat with friends. its worth stopping by to see what i mean you dont have to dress up its very laidback trust me. my regards to robert hes a very nice server and has been there for a very long time. so if you go there tell him miss renee said hello.

Lolita Back Bay,4,all i know is im sitting here wondering if that im not racist cats are trying to make the repeated of eminem renegade crazy. fries are fabulous food always fresh!
CLINK. and The Liberty Bar,4,"i have schizophrenic feelings towards toro.  my first impression was poor  the waitress who greeted us must had been having a terrible day as we didnt receive a smile from her the entire time.  she also appeared to be annoyed in general every time we asked her a question, like can we have some olive oil or butter to go with the bread?the food, however, was amazing. we kicked it off with the atun crudo  yellowfin tuna cebiche.  the mixture of soy, cucumbers, avocado, and a healthy dose of citrus made it a refreshing way to start off the meal.  we then had the lengua con lentejas y salsa verde aka beef tongue with lentils, and you guessed it, salsa verde.  the beef tongue was thinly sliced and very tender.  the lentils and the salsa verde turned out to be a match made in heaven. finally, we had the paella valenciana half size with mussels, clams, shrimp, chorizo, chicken, and rice. it was three home runs in a row  the only critical comment on the paella  it was a bit too salty!  it would had also been great if the server had brought out the beef tongue first, rather than bringing it out with the paella as it was difficult to eat both quickly enough before they got cold.afterwards, we asked another waiter if we could speak with the exec chef or owner as we were interested in learning more about the restaurant.  though neither were around, we were introduced to michael, who was cooking in the kitchen.  he was very patient and open to speaking with us and sharing us his thoughts. if not for that, this review would had been for three stars especially given that i found a strand of hair in my paella!"

Guira y Tambora,5,went here with my friend for lunch. we were seated promptly and the waiter immediately asked if we were limited on time due to a lunch break etc. we thought that was a nice touch.we both ordered the fish sandwich and both selected blackened. i therefore cant speak to the broader menu but that blackened fish sandwich was excellent. we both loved it. there was a good portion of fish in each one and it was cooked perfectly.we found that the restaurant was kept far cooler than we found comfortable and that is the reason we did not return. if you wrap up though you should enjoy it more than we did!
Maxs Deli Cafe,5,delicious food ambiance. great place for a special occasion
Sterling’s,5,"had to wait over 45 minutes for our food. burnt bacon, home fries half done and no flavor. his toast was saturated with butter and mine was totally dry."
Lala Rokh,5,its a cute hole in wall close to the commons. the pricing is reasonable and service quick. my husband and i both got tortas. he enjoyed his carnitas torta but my steak torta had barely any meat. if you like fast mexican food though. check this place out.
Domino's Pizza,5,"service wasnt great, the food selection seemed riskless and pretty run of the mill. i had the tuna carpaccio which while had some good flavors. it failed in that the components of the dish completely masked the tuna which was probably a good thing. they clearly froze the tuna in order to get such thin slices which is what you do with beef but never for tuna. the chowder was your standard creamy style that tasted good. fine for tourists however i probably wont be back."

Stoddard's Fine Food & Ale,5,"as someone who is not generally a fan of seafood, i approached my meal here with some trepidation. i was pleasantly surprised to discover that i found the salmon delicious, while my seafood loving fiancee found her lobster equally tasty. the service was quick and attentive, even though we were there during a busy lunch hour. that business did lead to some slightly higher noise levels, but nothing unmanageable. whether you are a fan of seafood or not and they do have some nonseafood menu items this is a great place to eat."

South End Pita,5,all you eat buffet
Cafe Quattro,5,had crab cakes and calamari they were good. also ordered a tin of 6 whole crabs to crake open ourselves. it was fun. very labor intensive. good experience but wont do that again. the line was really long and out the door. i think they need to find a more efficient way to service customers. maybe take electronic orders outside like portillos does. that way the can seat asap and have food out to turn tables faster.

Coach Grill,4,"if youve watched the show, its now time to experience it by visiting the restaurant. but its a must to , to take photos by the sign outside. everyone does it, so i feel it would be a good add to your photo collection! we had know idea what it would be like, but if you are patient and go with the whole experience, you will enjoy it. its was very crowded, and my son was starving but we waited by visiting the gift shops in the store and taking a stroll around the tv set bar on the top floor that was very crowded. we ended up finding a spot to sit at a bar in one of the other rooms and waited to be seated at the restaurant, the bartender was extremely busy but very nice! the beer and drinks were great.my son jace had fish n chips not the best he said but okay. my husband had theclam chowda traditionally prepared with fresh clams and generous chunks of maine potatoes, then finished with fresh cream. he said was good!and i had the blt wedge salad it was a wedge of crisp iceberg lettuce with apple wood smoked bacon, tomato, bleu cheese dressing and bleu cheese crumbles.for a drink we had the screaming viking the story behind the drink isit was a fictional drink that got sammys job back on the show after he sold cheers, our version is sure to win you over. a blend of bacardi mango, amaretto, pineapple juice and cranberry juice, with bacardi black floater on top. the drink was amazing!overlook the crowd, the hype and just take yourself back in time."
Tip Tap Room,4,the best pizza and pasta! great authentic place.
UNO Pizzeria & Grill,5,theyve only been open for 2 weeks so they are still working out some kinks. not great if you need to get in and out quickly im sure service will get faster as they hit their stride but very good food and friendly servers. manager obviously cares a lot about their success and is working hard on  making sure they address any glitches along the way.

JAK PIZZERIA,1,"unimpressed. i came here with a group of coworkers and although the burgers were good, i dont think well be coming back. the service was friendly, but unorganized. we had a handful of order mistakes, but to be fair, we werent charged for them.the food was good, but not what one would expect from an 11 burger and al la cart sides 45. after trying several of the sides one gets the sense that this place is trying too hard to be unique at the expense of tried and true tasty goodness. i would not recommend the onion rings or sweet potato fries.the consensus on the milkshakes was the same. not bad, not great, not worth the .if you are craving a solid burger in the area, brownestone and coda are just as good or better, and at a much better price."
One Bistro,4,great quick food. better than chipotle

Stats Bar & Grille,4,"so we had 6 people, ordered 3 appetizers, 1 being their nachos which was 12 and i think there was 12 chips on the plate, half of them had no cheese. so we tell the waiter if he could bring us a new one and he does but charges us for it! same exact crappy plate of chips. 24 for literally about 24 chips. i ordered the eggplant and it says its with red tomato sauce, so i assumed it came over some kind of pasta. nope, so i told the waiter im sry i assumed it came with pasta, could i have a small side of pasta? sure. got the bill, charged me 8 for a little dude if spaghetti. i could go on, but we were not impressed at all!"
Kindles Wood Fired Brick Oven Pizzeria,5,clean and good services
Abe & Louie's,3,"the wait on the weekends is crazy. around 6 pm on saturday, there was a wait of 20 parties. we were able to snag a bar table first comefirst serve, order our food and drinks at the bar, and sit within 5 minutes. i definitely recommend this option if youre in a party of 2 or 3.the view of the boston harbor is great, but this place is literally a shack. the bathroom is just big enough for the toilet, and the seating is so close to one another you really have to get comfortable. they also play top 20 songsedm which i really didnt think fit the tourist aspect of the restaurant. maybe theyre trying to be hip?what you should getfishchips 17fried fish sandwich 13both come with fries and coleslaw, and these really are the best options for this place. the food isnt that great of quality for the raw options, so i would suggest getting either one of these. the fish was cooked perfectly and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. the coleslaw was bland and runny, but it wasnt terrible. my sandwich was great, but honestly the whole restaurant was really loud, dirty, and more of a place to pregame with friends over beersdrinks."
Stelio's Family Restaurant,4,"to me this place is the definition of a hole in the wall treasure. it may not look fancy, but the food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable. i love getting their pupusas and breakfast plates."
Sarku Japan,4,had the fish and chips... it was just ok.  good beer batter but need some real tartar sauce.  instead it was plain mayo with a hint of malt vinegar.  i actually dug the malt flavor but was too bland.  biggest disappointment was onion rings.  most were teeny thin slivers often unchewable  like the papery outside pieces you should throw away. only one or two had a real chunk of onion.  iced tea was translucent with no flavor.  pretty blah for a 20 lunch.  cool patio but food needs work.
Chutneys Boston,5,love the corned beef hash and eggs!
Fire Dough Kitchen,1,"good service, but the food was blander and greasier than expected."
Rose's Chinese Restaurant,4,"great drinks, amazing food."
Café de Boston,4,we had a great time here. vegetarian options were very tasty. if you are there try and get seat at the bar by the open kitchen. we enjoyed how carefully and skillfully eat dish was made. highly recommended if you are in boston metro area.
Taiyaki NYC - Boston,5,not authentic ramen or thai noodle soup but are delicious nonetheless.
La Hacienda,5,great rooftop and our waitress jessica was awesome. she was extremely attentive to all of our asks

Burtons Grill & Bar of Shrewsbury,5,get the tequila sunrise!
The Horse Allston,5,"the burgers are always cooked well, and the freak frappes are something to behold. that being said, service is hit or miss, and when its bad its really bad. still a nice spot for a quick lunch."
Chilli Thai Bistro,2,waited for five minutes for service when there wasnt any cars in front of me only to receive a nine dollar order that wasnt fresh.  im all set with wendys.
Pollo Campero,3,great place for desserts after a night out at chinatown. cozy and romantic. prices are reasonable.
Prestige Cuisine,5,"oh my god! so good.its always the same order. a small roti with chicken curry. you get two sides with a small roti  i go for the spiced potatoes and the mango curry.the chicken curry is flavored really well, even a small bite is like an explosion of flavors in your mouth. the chicken is seasoned well and tender. as for the sides, the mango curry is a wonderful balance of sweet and spice and everything nice. the mango itself is cooked well and has a hint of sour to it  goes superbly well with the chicken. the potatoes help balance all the curries. there is a little bit of heat in the curries, some days more than others! im not sure what the roti is made of its not like the tandoori roti you get at indian restaurants but, oh my, it goes well with the curry and the sides. also, one time, they were out of the roti we got there 15 mins before closing time. so the staff substituted rice for the roti, which was delicious too!.dont let the outside fool you. it may not look like much but give the food a try and youll want it every day. the staff isnt very talkative but they are very nice and accommodating. this is definitely a favorite!"
Chinese Dragon,5,"we had the chocolate banana crepes and they were delicious! my only complaint is somehow a small piece of diced onion somehow got into my crepe, so that bite was rather disgusting, but it was just one bite and a fluke im sure. my husbands was onionfree. "
North Street Grille,5,"great time as always. get the standing room tickets. multiple long bars are nice. price is as expected, pricey."
Kantin,4,if  your looking for some of the best food in da bean this is a must visit!
Nico Ristorante,3,"if you are a ramen fanatic, this is definitely the place to go. i got the shio ramen, and although i thought it was a tad bit salty, as long as you ate it while it was hot, it was pretty good. the broth is very tasty as well, but i dont recommend drinking it as its extremely fatty and contains an unhealthy amount of sodium which is pretty normal for quality ramen. i spent about 15 dollars total for a generous portion of noodles. in addition, the atmosphere is quite nice and it definitely feels like something you would find on the streets of tokyo."
Yankee Lobster,4,i dont care for their coffee too bitter for me but their other offerings arent bad
Lucca Back Bay,5,the best pizza ive ever had! the atmosphere of the  pizzeria in the north end is amazing. you must visit whenever you are in boston.

Oisa Ramen,4,nice place. friendly service. great bloody marys!
Jim's Pizza,5,"i would only recommend going for the experience and nostalgia. the food was not a highlight for us and they charge too much for what you get. but, it was fun to see the place that inspired the tv show and see the similarities. they had lots of memorabilia to see and a great gift shop."

Flatbread Company Brighton,4,service is good. quantity could be better. the chilli cauliflower was good. other north indian food was acceptable.
Casa De Nana,5,"the atmosphere of this restaurant is pretty cool, and the food is good, but not great. the exception, however, is their cornbread, which is excellent.  its a little pricey, but most touristy places tend to be.  if youre in the area and youre interested, give it a go.  if you dont happen to get here, youre not missing out in too much."
Montien Thai Restaurant,5,"very polite and professional staff, great food and great service 5 stars across the board"

Top of the Hub,3,drive thru sometimes really busy
Dough East Boston,2,"loved using the groupon voucher with my friends for my birthday over the summer! then was delighted that i came back here with my coworkers for a networking event. compared to the dedham legacy place location the boston one definitely doesnt look as new or have as many lanes. they have a retro 50s style theme from the logo to the interior design. conveniently located at a 5 minute walk away from the hynes convention t stop and with an adjoining garage with a huge kings banner, it was an easy place to find.without the promotion, id say that the prices for bowling and rentals is a bit inflated compared to other bowling places. definitely keep an eye out for the vouchers. the food at this place is decent, but nothing mind blowing. i think the dedham location may be better. we had the cheese and fruit plate, scallop with bacon, beef teriyaki skewers, various flatbreads, sloppy joe sandwiches and way too much other food we couldnt finish unfortunately for my work group. they have custom drinks such as the dude, which were reasonably priced and tasty.overall we all had fun each time, but maybe due to the age of place there were several instances that when the pin reset there was one missing. this place also has the air hockey tables, but you need prepaid coins in order activate these machines. just due to the distance away from me i would rather try my luck with parking in legacy place rather than schlepping into boston unless i was already in the area. worth noting that they do validate for parking, which helps a little bit."
Black Seed Cafe & Grill,5,great location in downtown crossing boston! very friendly staff and as fresh as it can be fast food! reasonable prices for a downtown tourist area.
Boston Tavern,4,service was slow and there were mistakes with our orders.

Boston Fried Chicken,5,authentic korean fried chicken. it tasted good.
Doña Habana Restaurant,4,"my colleague and i were in boston for an academic conference at the weston waterfront and decided to come here on saturday evening. we both know our sushi and agreed that this was some of the freshest and best fish weve had in a long time. our server was knowledgable and made some excellent recommendations. all in all, i would definitely come back here on my next trip to boston if only for more toro and sake!"
Exodus Bagels,5,"went here on a saturday evening. place was hopping with 2 kids parties. there are not very many lanes so the wait for bowling was hours. we decided to sit down and eat anyway. took awhile for our server to come over and i watched as the table next to us was also ignored for 1015 min after they sat down. great beer selection and i am always excited to see maine root beer on the menu. for some reason our pizza took forever to come out. our pizza was comped, and the server was very apologetic and kept us up to date on what was happening. i am chalking it up to being relatively new and having 2 parties happening at once. i have been to other flatbread locations and love it. so this will not deter me from trying this location again."
Skooter's,5,highly enrich food served here.... food with roots.
Clay Pot Cafe,5,"really great food... we had an excellent dinner. the service was also excellent. and their prices are pretty amazing for a restaurant in boston  very reasonable. the only caveat... very small space so you sit in very close quarters. cant recommend this as a romantic dinner spot, and conversation can be a bit difficult.at times... can get pretty loud when its busy, which is always  make a resevation!"
South End Buttery,3,good taste 
by CHLOE. - Fenway,4,translated by google the fried milk is delicious!original
Chutneys Boston,5,"pretty good bar food. drinks are overpriced for what they are. late night bar food and loud music are the reasons people come here. it gets a little crazy here on weekends, so expect standing room and struggling for attention from servers unless you can bully up a table."
Boston Pizza & Grill,5,good place convenient to my doctor at joslins
Chicken Lou's Inc,5,ive been going to this place since i was a kid  ive tried pizza  arancinis from many other restaurants  nothing compares to umbertos.

Dig,5,"120 dollars if you include tip for 2 sodas and lobster ravioli lunch.  good food and nice environment, but not that good."
Saigon Hut,5,everything they offer is so fresh and delicious. definitely no skimping on portionsquality either. definitely would recommend stopping here for a gyro or some of their amazing street doughnut balls.

The Playwright Bar,5,translated by google it eats very goodoriginalse come bien rico
Lolita Fort Point,5,the website says they do delivery in east boston. when you call them.. they ask you where you stay and then they refuse delivery once the information is given. why ask so many questions when youre not going to deliver?

Santarpio's Pizza,5,awesome margarita prices by the liter!
Lotus Blossom,4,this place is always sad and lame. usually a desk with nobody in the entrance so just wait and pray someone passes by and care...
Boston Burger Co-Boylston,4,"great place to grab an ipa and watch the game. i came with a bigger party and we got the worst service. took forever to order and forever to get a beer. i actually had to ask again for my second beer. the waitresses were not running around as if they had a couple of big parties, so im assuming their tips sucked at the end of the night."
Boston Sail Loft,4,"i spent my 30th birthday dinner here. great place for big party dinners. food was delicious, drinks were on point. service was attentive and ready. i highly recommend to come here before the start of a night out in the city. affordable prices too. the plates were good portions as well."
7 Chinese Restaurant,3,we love the q!
North Street Grille,4,good date place. its a bit more expensive than other shabu places in boston but the location is convenient. hits the spot on those cold days when you need delicious soup broth.
Quic Pic BBQ,5,deals the are best way to visit this place
Great Barbecue,5,"i have gone here for years with family and before being diagnosed with gluten intolerance i had a lot of options to enjoy! but sadly there are very limited gluten free options and the staff do not seem knowledgeable.  as someone who works in foodservice i know that if you dont know the answer you say no. so everything was off limits apart from some sushi, nigiri, sashimi and plain rice."
Halal Indian Cuisine,4,"great thai food in the midst of the theater district and on the edge of chinatown. ive tried several of their dishes, including the scrumptious drunken noodles which i recommend which are perfectly spicy as well as the sriracha delight. theres also an authentic thai menu which i have yet to try but which looks amazing. overall a little on the pricey side, but i scored a 10 discount by paying cash."
Liuyishou Hotpot,5,great drinks in a lively setting.  service was excellent.
La Chiva Restaurant,4,seriously beta burger by design
Santarpio's Pizza,4,food was outstanding!!
The Chateau Restaurant Norwood,5,"group of over over 12 people.  we asked to receive split checks before the food actually came out although after we placed the orders, and waitress wouldnt do it, even though the place wasnt busy.  staff subtly tries to rush us when it takes us a quite a while to figure out the bill.  thats what happens when you dont split the check guys.  less than 5 minutes from your waitress wouldve saved 20 minutes of us figuring out the bill.this bill payment also wouldve been less difficult if they had not charged us for bottled water at over 4.00 per 12 oz bottle, that was left on the table at the start, and similar dirty charging for sparkling water.  we didnt ask for it, and if its there at the start, id assume it to be complimentary.  sleazy.food was mediocre as well.  meatball appetizer was obviously microwaved, with still cold center."
Bricco,4,really good bbq. best brisket i have ever had!
Tremont 647,4,good food service and prices. nice place to go.
Fin's Japanese Sushi & Grill,5,"tasty lobster good service, great place."
Uno Pizzeria & Grill,1,"just go anywhere else!i have a really long story of why this place is terrible, but i just dont want to waste any more of my time on them. just move along and order from any other pizza place from the area. i assure you that papa ginos has better food, customer service and you wont get violently ill or food poisoning."
Rowes Wharf Sea Grille,5,love the food and the drinks!
Tasty Burger,4,"called in a pick up order. when i arrived they told me they did not have my pizzas ready. meanwhile, 3 guys in the kitchen were taking group photos to post on snapchat. after a few minutes of confusion.. i was then told my 40 pizza order was not communicated to the kitchen to make or they accidentally gave it to another patron. zero hospitality ..zero accountability.. zero management. good thing i took an uber there to not actually pick up pizza. i would give zero stars if i could. cancelled!!"
Chutneys Boston,5,rapest. prices go up on take out by 3 dollars after a certain hour. rude staff.

Num Pang Kitchen,5,ultimate japanese food destination!!! great music!!!
The Plum Tomato,5,"i couldnt give 5 stars for 2 reasons1, the line to order was about 10 minutes and the cashier kept saying im out of at exactly 3 oclock and she asked the person before us to hold on a minute while she put her coat before she took his order.2, there was a long hair in my chicken, but the person behind the counter took care of it and apologize. because of her professionalism i gave 3 stars."

Pho Hoa,5,just ok food
Hungry Tiger Pizza,5,good french cuisine. duck or tagliatelle are both a good option. we ordered cheese and tuna tataki as a sides and were very good too. its not cheap if the wine is on the table but it worth the price. ill go back no doubt.

异国他湘 Bubor cha cha,3,looved it! staff was really nice and accommodating. randy was the best. he made my sisters birthday memorable. they gave us the private room on the house. they also gave my sister the most delicious chocolate ice cream dessert on the house. the food was delicious. their house drink its complicated is definitely a must try. will come back again and again.

Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse,3,translated by google good food originalbuena comida 
Coco Leaf,3,best food in town
Chilacates Amory St,2,"no shakes, slow service"
Anna's Taqueria,3,broadway tavern is one of those corner bars in downtown boston where you can be treated to a great meal. they have a good selection of salads hamburgers but the real draw is there draft beers and ipas and lagers and stouts. i always find its rather busy the staff is nice but doesnt really have time to hang out with you and make you feel good.
Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5,"place is good but super expensive for no reason. way overpriced compared to the eventide in maine. we got the larger lobster roll, a soup and a few beers. beer on tap was actually really cheap. ive had better lobster rolls else where and even the ones i make sure home are better than the ones here."
Ixtapa Mexican Grill & Cantina,4,if service was good and the location was bigger this would easily be a 5 star.
West End Pizza,4,the food was great good prices atmospheres comfortable

Paradise Biryani Pointe,3,"it might have been good if i got a table. but after an hour of waiting and watching several tables get up and leave, they insisted they were still at capacity. in fact we never did get the call saying our table was available. the worst part is they initially told us it would only be 10 minutes. anyways, im sure the chicken is fine, but i didnt get to eat it."
Panda Express,5,wasnt to bad for me just ordered from their now... no complaints from me and the kids and wife....
Paris Seaport Bar + Creperie,5,this sushi has to be the best ive ever tried in boston. i will always come back to their menu.

Galleria Umberto,5,"yup, its a wendys. you know what you are getting."
Pedro's Tacos,5,"translated by google the union oyster house  what can you say. nice, rustic, not without reason national historic landmark. you must have seen it for sure. eat? if you can, even if you do not like oysters, the map offers enough alternatives. but, a little bit of charm loses that when equipped with headsets abrumer after each guest immediately create order and make via headset message and the next guests are led to the place. also the remoulade placed in plastic cups on the plate and the presented cold slaw which i was too bland cloud the rustic and traditional ambience and experience.  18 for a fish sandwich and fries are not exactly cheap. even if the fish was really good. overall, the priceperformance ratio is right, water is always refilled, cornbread and knabberkram is included. one certainly does not meet many different people of bostonians, but definitely romans, munichers, parisians .... originaldas union oyster house  was soll man sagen. nett, rustikal, nicht ohne grund national historic landmark. gesehen haben muss man es sicher. essen? kann man, auch wenn man keine austern mag, bietet die karte genug alternativen. aber, ein wenig an charme verliert das ganz wenn mit headsets bestckte abrumer nach jedem gast sofort ordnung schaffen und via headset meldung machen und die nchsten gste an den platz gefhrt werden. auch die in plastikbechern auf dem teller platzierte remoulade und der ebenso prsentierte cold slaw der mir zu fad war trben die rustikale und traditionelle ambiente und erlebnis.  18 dollar fr ein fisch sandwich und pommes sind nicht gerade gnstig. auch wenn der fisch wirklich sehr gut war. insgesamt stimmt das preisleistungsverhltnis schon, wasser wird immer wieder nachgefllt, cornbread und knabberkram ist inklusive. man trifft auf viele verschiedene menschen bostonians sicher nicht aber bestimmt auf rmer, mnchner, pariser....

Viva Burrito,5,bad service. average food

Red Lantern Restaurant & Lounge,1,best value for poke bowls and burritos!
Five Guys,4,have been eating here for years and never one bad bite of anything. clean and friendly staff.
D'Guru,1,"food was great. we had dinner late and the night and surroundings were beautiful. my mango mojito was delicious, but my mans long island iced tea was not as good. my biggest complaint though was the server. he kinda lacked on service. no utensils were given when we sat, so when we got our food we had to tell the cook that brought our food we didnt have utensils. a few minutes later the server came out with them. a couple times we needed service he was not around and we had to wait long for him each time, mind you the place was empty.."
Stelio's Family Restaurant,5,"the place is nice,  service is good and the taste of the food is good as well.  we had the spring spring rolls which were tasty,  the golden bags which were ok,  the tom yum was really good and pad siew and green curry.  everything was well seasoned and not bland.  we also had the thai tea which was also really good.  i recommended if you get it to ask for less ice as there was more ice than drink. only giving 4 stars because i think it is a tad overpriced but i guess its because of location."

CAVA,4,"i love the great food, informality and personalised service... bit like eating at home."
Cask 'n Flagon,5,"food was delicious and service was good. the only reason why boston market is struggling right now as a company is the lack of attention to detail within their restaurants. they need to renovate their locations and impress upon their employees the importance of presentation thoroughly clean spills, look professional, etc. the food and recipes are already there, which is the hardest part!"
Shake Shack,5,i had some excellent tacos here and ive had some terrible tacos here. stay away from chicken and duck as they tend to be very dry.

Expresso Pizza,4,"i got a chicken plate with a side of refried beans. the service is great. its fast and the cashier was super friendly.the food was soso. im biased though, so take this with a grain of salt no pun intended lol.the flavors in the plate were not balanced. it was 100 savory 100 of the time, bordering on salty. when i eat, i like a bit of variety in flavors. i like hints of sweet even if the dish itself should be a savory one. either way, it was good, but lacking complexity.ill definitely go there in a pinch but wont make it a staple.ill try their guac next time and see what thats like..."
Burger King,5,"my absolute favorite take out in boston! whod think of korean and mexican fusion, but its genius, and you have to try it.  the coreanos bowl is amazing, tacos and korean style wings are terrific, and service is great. dont miss it!"

by CHLOE. - Boston Seaport,3,the salmon and egg don and the chasu don were okay but didnt blow me away. meat is not that soft

Tia's,4,i come here when i want hot soup but am too lazy tired to cook anything. the reason it gets a 3 and not a 5 is because the quality of the ingredients is not great. i always see a bunch of cooks in the kitchen but i have no idea what they do. slice meat all day? probably not as the meat is frozen. stir the broth? could be. not good value but i end up here because im lazy and i love soup.
Kelley Square Pub,5,a nicely done 1920s themed bar. came here on valentines day for some very tasty love themed cocktails and dinner. we sat in the latenight speakeasy lounge in the back with vintage lighting and pool tables. i also really like how most of the cocktails stay within the theme providing a brief history lesson. cant comment on those though. my sweetheart and be mine were too good to pass up!

Strega Italiano Back Bay,4,"we took a trip into boston last week to take a look through the new eataly. when this establishment was built, it required closing down all of the food court restaurants in the pru that were used by thousands of people a day. we used that experience as our baseline, could eataly offer a replacement for affordable experiences for the many people who want a quick bite to eat?overcrowding in the establishment meant that the shopping experience was rushed, we could not properly identify everything for sale, and navigating this place was downright hazardous. im not sure if the people at the front were actually checking maximum occupancy numbers, but we quickly identified that it was a major fire hazard to be in the building, and we promptly left after identifying it simply wasnt safe to be there. if an emergency or fire had happened while we were there, which is likely with so many restaurants in close proximity, all the people in the building would be forced out two emergency exits, the only ones we could find that were open. it was a death trap.we did get an opportunity to browse some selections of items to purchase, however the costs for those items were exorbitant. we searched for quick grab and go dining options to compare with eatalys locational predecessors, and we really couldnt find much in that category. it seemed they did have some nooks and places with things, but they were sporatically laid out, in a clear attempt to get you to browse items for sale getting to and from the limited selections available. in a crowded space, this was just frustrating.one of the problems that occurs to me is that eataly is catering, literally, to residents of the area. the majority of people visiting the pru are tourists. do you think they want to bring home raw pasta? cheese? raw meats? how many local residents do they think will buy all these things? they do have an excellent selection of things like cheese, for example, but theres lots of supermarket style offerings that require cooking, and i dont think people are going to want to buy those things and take them home with them. there isnt a market for it.i strongly feel that the new eataly location in the pru has detrimentally robbed the area of all previous low cost dining options for workers and tourists in the area. with the hynes convention center seeing thousands of person attendance for events, and people who want a quick bite to eat, eataly isnt offering selections to cater to what people will want, instead opting for a higher class shopping experience for athome cooks. i anticipate that eataly will have to refocus its sales position and offerings within a year to accommodate for their lack of market research. this, in addition to their disregard for overcrowding hazards, means i can only give this establishment a onestar review at this time."

"Happy Lamb Hot Pot, Boston 快乐小羊",1,"there are no signs outside when i went to eat. i ended up walking past it a couple of times before realizing it. i made a reservation and i arrived just on time. i walked in its a small place with a handful of tables and told the waitress that i had a reservation. she told me that it would be 10 minutes and said to leave, walk around and then come back. at first i was taken aback, because of the way that she spoke to us. she was quite blunt and borderline rude. by the way, if you want to come during peak dinner times make sure you have a reservation because its a small place that fills up very quickly. at one point the waitress was turning people away who didnt have a reservation. after waiting it out we came back and were seated. we quickly realized that for such a tiny place, reservations were hard to keep on time so they did a reasonable job all things considered. after that we ordered our food. we got the stew with the mussels and that was delicious. it was a huge amount and im very happy that we split it in two. for the dinner we got the cherrystone clams linguini in white sauce and vegetable risotto. personally i preferred the linguini but i would happily take either one. the food was absolutely delicious. the dinner ended with the tiramisu which ive never had but my girlfriend has and she claimed that it was one of the best that shes ever tasted. overall it was a great experience and great food. now back to that waitress, she ended up being super nice and accommodating. she is blunt, and could come off as rude but her intentions are very good and i enjoyed having her as our waitress. i will definitely be coming back."

Chicken And Rice Guys,4,"thats my spot, for dominican food."
Bistro du Midi,5,"the food is very subpar.  the fish was tasteless and kind of slimy.  the white rice was even more tasteless and had a very starchy feel.  after eating a full plate of this lousy fish dish i was really really hungry i felt malnourished and very dissatisfied!  to add insult to injury, they tacked an extra dollar on the bill for the lousy dish.  they did so just because i ordered the dish during late night.  lastly on top of all that, the wait service is pushy and very unfriendly!  i definitely dont ever plan on going back there!"
Suculento Restaurante,5,"i see why they dont post their prices anywhere...i ordered the broccoli and chicken ziti but substituted the chicken for shrimp. the guy taking my order on the phone was nice and he did inform me there would be an upcharge for the shrimp. i understand that as all places charge more for a seafood substitute. i said no problem. i was expecting an extra 56 charge. to my surprise when i picked up my food, the gentleman said thatll be 29. for broccoli and shrimp ziti and some garlic bread. seriously? i stupidly handed over my credit card all the while thinking why the hell was is it so much?? i couldve went to olive garden and got the tour of italy, an appetizer and a dessert for that price. i got to work to see 4 yes four shrimp in my ziti. wow... on top of that  the ziti was lackluster, i make better at home and i had to dump a ton of seasonings on theirs to invoke some flavor. im totally disappointed and i feel like they grossly overcharged me. i admit i was stupid to pay it but i learned my lesson and i wont be going back there again."

Joe's On Newbury,5,"full menu all day.i hear about some fast food places serving breakfast later but im more of a lunch in the morning type. sometimes you need a burger and a shake at 9am. well maybe you dont, but i do.the shakes are top notch, get a hot fudge shake. its like somebody threw a chocolate hot fudge sunday in the blender.service is a little slow here or this would be 5 star. the shakes and early morning lunches keep me coming back."

Bertucci's,4,their guac burger is really good!!
Hong Kong Harbor,4,our favorite dishes were mussels and beef cheeks. rest dishes we tried were mostly good. restaurant has lights hanging across room gave us backyard atmosphere. there was no table available when we got there so we sat at bar our dinner. the female bartender was very nice and helpful. overall it was very positive experience.

Grill 23 & Bar,4,"i wasnt terribly impressed by this place. i ordered a cocktail from their menu which was quite sour and we got nachos to share which were awful. for an after work drink it seemed like an ok place though if you just wanted a beer. although it has a strong air of pretension which the food and drinks we tried did not live up to. ambience isnt the only measure of a good place.one very positive note not to be ignored on the wednesday night we were there, they had a live 3 person band playing classic jazzypop lowkey tunes. the singer was beautiful and the music perfect for the atmosphere. again thumbs up for the atmosphere, thumbs down for what we paid for..."
Saloniki Greek,5,pretty tasty burgers
Mangia Mangia Italian Kitchen,3,my favorite fried chicken place.

Capo Restaurant & Supper Club,5,"the debut restaurant of a chef who grew up in public housing projects in south boston, no. 9 parks name refers to its address on the ground floor of a beacon hill townhome in the heart of the city, virtually across the street from the state house. the location thusly attracts many of the kind of pols and businessmen responsible for the very policies and avarice that undoubtedly contributed to barbara lynchs early impoverishment. vengeance would be tempting, but lynch did better she made no. 9 park into one of bostons best restaurants, and herself into one of americas most revered chefs and businesswomen.despite possessing elegance in spades, no. 9 park is no dollhouse. tables are minimally decorated, and unassuming chairs are provided for comfort rather than ornamentation. brown wood paneling creates an upscale feel without necessarily being fancy. the food looks appetizing, but not in an ocd lets break out the tweezers way like at lynchs newer, swankier, relais  chteauxlisted flagship restaurant, menton.here, the usage of cuttingedge culinary technology is kept minimal, along with flavors and ingredients that are kept basic. despite that, there is perhaps more than meets the eye to a lot of the dishes, such as the famed bolognese sauce that serious eats j. kenji lpezalt recently revealed was buoyed by pulverized chicken livers as its secret ingredient during his stint in the kitchen at no. 9 park.barbara lynchs restaurants love french and italian cuisines and finding the interplay between both. the best example of this is no. 9 parks foie grasinfused gnocchi stuffed with prune pure, which has been on the menu since forever and is one of my favorite bites of food in all of boston, if not all of anywhere. this is a complex dish, with a taste of prune that is delightful yet fleeting, chased down ones gullet by an oaky nuttiness from the almonds. another pasta dish i recently enjoyed was no. 9 parks ultrarich farfalle in its delectable gravy sauce made of braised boar, with fennel caramelized to the point of being crispy. thankfully i had this as part of a tasting, because a regular entresized bowl could stop hearts, both figuratively and literally. similarly, the butterpoached salmon was about as rich of a salmon dish as one will eat. this is not a restaurant id go to while dieting.although nonbostonians may mistake any collection of regulars in the saloon as evidence of provinciality, there is no mistaking the fact that no. 9 park is a lively restaurant with a unique social atmosphere encouraged by jovial servers who react to your needs before you are even aware of them.  in my halfdozen or so visits, i have always had fantastic service here. during my most recent meal, i casually shared with my waiter my preference for whole foie gras dishes over terrines and was surprised with a bonus dish with my tasting a swoonworthy plate of seared hudson valley foie gras over a pile of satiny duck confit and pomegranate with a pair of sweet potato agnolotti, which were beautiful little dumplings filled with nothing short of nirvana.i consider the chefs tasting menu one of the bestvalue dgustations in boston, as there are always bonuses and treats added in addition to the stated courses, which are all of decent size. during my most recent visit february 2018, the chefs tasting menu was 125, plus 7 tax, plus tip. you could spend a lot more for a lot less in boston.no. 9 park is turning 20 years old in a few weeks. in many other cities, it could qualify as a historic restaurant. yet, to me, each visit to this excellent restaurant still feels new and fresh, which is part of what makes it a special place."

RUKA,4,"came here for drinks and food. i like the atmosphere inside. its a bit dark and gothicy. place is always packed so be warned. both times i came here it was extremely hard to find a place to sit. tables were booked for hours. drinks were tasty but nothing crazy. i wasnt a huge fan of the spicy margarita but they had many different types. the food is tapas style but very pricey. we tried tacos, nachos with 3 different dips. food was mediocore and very pricey for the portion you get. would skip food here and just do drinks!"
Boston Seafood,5,"slow drive through. old food, so whats the hold up. ticket times for this place should be under 6 minutes. 7 minutes tops to be reasonable, but then the food is stuff thats been holding on the production line? so why so slow. youre not busy preparing fresh beef, not cooking fries or bacon for the burgers, are you just not paying attention, it seems like that may be the magic answer. if i had a longer lunch break id be opting for complaining in person but since k had to drive back to work because ordering my food and receiving it took 18 minutes of my 30 minute lunch window, and it takes approximately 6 minutes to get back to my office. thanks for nothing."
906 Homwin Chinese Restaurant,5,"order the spicy chicken shwarma plate.  when ordering you get to pick a salad, hummus and rice. i went with the fatoush salad where as my friend got the greek salad tabouleh is also an option. both salads were delicious, not too oily or salty which is usually a problem at middle eastern restaurants in the states.  to top it off you get a nice warm piece of pita bread which completed the entire dish.go with the spicy garlic sauce which went perfectly with the chicken. it wasnt too spicy and was a nice compliment to the salad.the portions here are huge. the whole platter which cost 11 could easily have been split between 2 people but for such a low price why bother splitting."

Wolfgang,5,"a disappointing first impression at bastille. while the vibe is cool, in a happening area, the dining was just so so. we found the price extremely high for what we ordered.the charcuterie board was underwhelming with only a 23 slices of meat, a few pieces of cheese, tapenade and pickled vegetables.we ordered two flat breads. the wild mushroom was very good, and the highlight of the meal. the pork belly was way too rich. thick cut fatty pork belly with cheddar cheese made for a very oily flatbread.overall, i was shocked at the price for a few rounds of drinks and apps. will most likely not come back.alas..."

Dunkin',4,a terrific food experience. a brilliant mixing of asian flavors with american stylings and tiki essentials. the whole fish is an absolute highlight. sticky rice in the can was an rive touch. the tiki drinks are underwhelming by tiki standard but bring an air of differentiation to the restaurant as a whole. highly recommend.

Target Pizza,5,"although cheap eats here are appreciated, they are coupled with earpiercing music that they pump relentlessly at their customers. the loudness of the music forces all patrons to have to literally scream to talk to the people sitting right next to them. the staff was attentive enough, but its impossible to enjoy your time over the noise."
Blu,1,"if youre craving wings, this is the place to go. the soy garlic wings are to die for. the parmesan fries are the yummiest fries with a spicy mayo bbq flavored sauce.  this time i went with my friends, we had the tuna tataki and a brooklyn mason jar. the mason jar is the way to go for a group of people. the vibe at crave is always great and upbeat"

Sixth Gear - Cask & Kitchen,4,terrible attitude from the staff. we sat outside at 815 but were 3 times rudely told not to sit there because of brunch at 9am even though weve done that a number of times before. im fine with being told but 2 members of staff were rude to us. will go to flour next time.

Nico Ristorante,4,upscale gastro pub style venue that sits a bit on the expensive side.  popular but still accommodating for larger style groups.  they have an above average sized beer menu and its full of good craft beer.  cocktails are delicious and varied.  calamari appetizer was very good and i highly recommend the short rib and gnocchi.
Pizza Place,3,"cheap, good italian eats. order by watching what others eat, as the staff gets confused as to whats what i got a meat arancini when i asked for just cheese. understandable, given the very long lines."

Fat Baby,5,great food. and god service too.
Amrheins Restaurant,5,"this place has the best chicken sharwarma plate. the chicken is so flavorful and flagrant that you will crave another days later. the plate comes with fries, pickled vegetables and this garlic sauce that is to die for. you have to come to this place if you like sharwarma wraps. another plus is they use halal meat."
Mythos Pizza,5,this place took too long to even get us to the order screen.  only to have a order taker with a bad attitude.  rude and short.  how does mcdonalds not have hot tea?.  i ordered fish with extra pickles i got the standard two with two cold large fries.  since the food took literally more than 3mins why is it not fresh hot and correctly made!. then the rude cashier at the window puts a cold lid on a hot cup full of steaming hot water and got an attitude when asked for a hot cup lid. as if shes paying for it with her check!. but yall want 15 and hr.  this is why we have so many moving forward with tech!..  by far one of the worse customer service experiences ive had in a while!.  never even offered bbq! . ill be bringing my fish back for a remake! the last pic is my remade old fish. i hate giving bad reviews

Mezcala Tex Mex Grill,5,it was great experience over there but they didnt bring everything we wanted. my waiter asked me for a tips which was really awful. i am from new york and i know what to do in restaurants. usually i dont expect customer service in chinese restaurants but this place is worst. i have never encountered anything like that in my life.

Sbarro,3,"my wifes company does some regular events here and over the years ive become pretty disenchanted with grill 23. the food is decent, but their bar service is horrible. after ordering a drink with a specific bourbon i watched as the bartender instead filled the glass with the cheapest makers mark at the bar. ive found that i have to specify everything exactly on even simple drinks or they come back filled with strange addins and cheap liquor that ruin the cocktail. honestly i dont think the place is really deserving the numerous accolades it receives from the local reviews."
My Thai Vegan Cafe,2,i absolutely love dunkin donuts!!
Lucia Ristorante,5,iced hazelnut latte is excellent
Mehak Halal Cuisine,4,"update ok, so now this is my go to place for margaritas, taco and quesadillas.  everything is authentic and very delicious.  we get the don julio agave margarita in a pitcher and its probably the best margarita ive ever had!  ive only had a margarita and some chips and salsa but both were great!  the blueberry lemonade margarita was delicious!  so flavorful and tasty!  the salsa was not chunky the way i like it and some kick to it.  so far, very happy!  i will update my review when i got there for dinner soon."

McCormick & Schmick's,4,pretty expensive for what it is and not that great. itll get the job done after a few hours in the museum and is cheaper than some of the other options but youre definitely better off bringing your own picnic lunch. theres a courtyard right next to it too

PURO ceviche bar,2,"im a little disappointed that i paid almost 25 for a steak tip salad and received no eating utensils or salad dressing for that matter. even worse i paid for extra salad dressing and didnt receive any at all. i know its only 25 but i kind of feel robbed, especially since i paid for extra dressing and received none at all. highly disappointed."
Better Sorts Social Club,5,"called ahead to confirm that dim sum ran all day long sunday. arrived around 130 pm and was seated immediately, great!service was a bit slow, they werent producing much we had to order from the kitchen.quality was good not great,but the price was dirt cheap."

sweetgreen,5,"i was pleasantly surprised by the food of this joes. some of the other franchises ive visited have been underwhelming, but the food of this joes was pretty good. the bread is addicting, prices are not cheap but reasonable, portions are medium enough to have leftovers but not a whole other meal, and service seemed fine. overall it was a good experience. not my top choice, but definitely a solid backup."

The Maiden,3,chill environment and good coffee.
Cheers,5,really great aesthetic  amazing and cheap food. strongly recommend.
Jeveli's,5,"there arent many buffets in metrowest and this is one of the few. its a large buffet with a pretty good variety. most of the dishes are similar to those found in other chinese buffets. the dessert table is pretty large with a variety of fruit, cakes, and other baked goods. so, if you feel like choking down, this is a pretty good choice."
Back Bay Social,5,"we met friends for dinner and everyone was pleasantly surprised not only with the meal, but the humourous hints throughout the restaurant. the menu was italian with flair. the pasta servings were delicious, if on the smaller size. our waiter, charlie, advised us of this before, however, and we added appetizers to fill out the meal. just the right amount. the atmosphere  is comfortable cozy with warm wood tones, and the service staff is attentive and accommodating. it was a genuinely satisfying new adventure for us."
South End Pita,4,i was expecting more for a north end italian.  food came out staggered with long delays for our group.
Boston Fried Chicken,5,"cheap place for an all you can eat. lots of ingredients to choose from and when considered that they make it on the spot its fast. but the experience over can be a bit tedious. like, going to gather the ingredients in the bowl and then waiting for them to cook it can get annoying so i might not go there again. but ya, it wasnt bad and its definitely good for a one time visit."
Tony's Pizza and Restaurant,5,"beware! this is restaurant where you  must tip even if you receive lousy service they dont care here its all about the pizza, lamb, beer and the patrons which keep this place alive. yes it does have the best pizzas you will ever find in boston but its not really what youl expect it to be its always almost burnt its thing and extremley salty  mostly and very greasy but its the old recipe that keeps you coming back for more. the lamb is fresh the bread is excellent and the peppers  though i dont like them are very good so if your around and in boston  a 1 time visit here is a must its not better than reginas in the north end but it comes very close also a 3 tip here is  not  acceptable they want at  least 5 even though its never been updated and as i said depending on who your server is the food can suck but never the less its very good just know before you go before you walk in  they  treat every one the same wether your a regular or out of town also depending on the day or time it gets very busy so a line is not uncommon to see out the door and a 20 min wait happens more than it appears even if it looks  empty it always fills up fast. give it a try and see for yourself its not for everyone i  guess it all just depends on your experience which will either make you want to come back again and again or walk away its an old school joint always has been always will continue to be it doesnt change  ever! trust me."
Pepperoni Express,5,"very busy and cold. air conditioner is on when it is cold outside. the music is so loud and does not have a suitable ambience for relaxing, or studying. for meeting a friend and have a coffee however is not bad. the drinks and food are also good."

Chumlee's,5,"during my visit, a waitress dropped a vase on me from behind she was working on them on the ledge behind my head instead of a counter. i also found a cockroach crawling on the wall at my booth, and when i stopped a server to show him, he said it wasnt a cockroach. then the manager came by the booth later and apologized for the roaches and said they had been treating for them. eew, eew, eww. i just wish i had seen the roach earlier so we could have left before the exceedingly long wait for our food!"
The Courtyard Tea Room,5,"dj needs work, spend some money on one that can blend some beats and not have deadspace. vip experience is lacking, waitresses running away,, 5 hosts and no one knows what table is what."
State Street Provisions,4,always a good meal.at a good price
Andre's Cafe,5,"food is consistently great. on the spicier side and very well done. space is small, so it can get crowded. we brought kids, but went early on a saturday and they were very accommodating. drinks were a little weak. hostess was a little frosty but our wait staff were excellent and super accommodating. would go back because we like the food and because the wait staff were so great."
Greenhills Irish Bakery,5,food is tasty
No.9 Park,5,always good!!!

UNO Pizzeria & Grill,5,i used to fine here a lot...over the months i have seen their service degrade drastically. the quality of waiters are degrading as well. i would have given them a 5 star only if my past 3 experiences are improved but they havent. i dont recommend this place unless you only want to buy cheesecake and leave.

Stephi's on Tremont,4,"first visit to this wellestablished restaurant in sudbury after it was recommended by an acquaintance. in short, this was one of the better dining experiences weve had in several years.first impressions are great. the place is well maintained with abundant parking. dcor is elegant, yet simple and very classy, giving the place a very definite upscale vibe. place was very busy reservations strongly suggested, yet noise levels were low enough to comfortably carry a conversation without having to raise our voices or strain to listen to the other party.we were waited upon by todd  an energetic your man who seemed to always know when we needed something. staff was very attentive and pays attention to even fairly minor details, such as the orientation of cutlery and positioning of glasses with respect to each other.regardless of all the other niceties, the real treat here is the food. my wife ordered a mussels appetizer and an eveningspecial swordfish entree, both of which were expertly prepared, beautifully presented and delicious i had a french onion soup that was superb  abundant onions, flavorful consomme, and a well blended, perfectly molten blend of cheeses. the black and blue filet was really medium rare, with color transitions demonstrating its a realtime cook rather than something sitting in a sousvide bath for hours before you arrive. the mixture of flavors and textures was simply sublime. portions are generous, though not unreasonably so.the restaurants wine cellar is nevertheless very well stocked and very reasonably priced.in summary i would give them six stars if i could. this is the rare place that gets everything right  the look, the atmosphere, the service, the drinks, the food.this place is worth visiting again, and doing so often."

Las Delicias Colombianas 2,5,"im not a big meateater, but i really enjoyed the classic prosciutto, cheese, pizza margherita, and wine. we sat at a communal table, but it wasnt too loud and nobody sat directly next to us. well, except for the people who initially sat themselves next to us the host is supposed to seat you, complained about the communal seating, and then moved to the bar. "

The Ginger Man,4,"i see the rave reviews here and im not sure if i ordered the wrong version of the hot chocolate!its the typical setting  cold boston day, you want to warm up. why not a delicious creamy hot chocolate? l.a. burdick, here we come.when we got there, it looked like everyone had the same idea as us. it was full. thankfully, we scored a table in a few minutes. there are only 67 tables, not meant for large groups. to order, you have to go up to the counter. once you order, they give you a number and the server brings the food to your table.we ordered a small dark hot chocolate and a classic gugelhupf for dessert. i asked if they serve it with marshmallows, but they dont. oh well. it took only a few minutes for our order to be ready. the hot chocolate was very disappointing, honestly. it had a sourish taste and wasnt sweet at all. i wondered for a minute if i should be adding sugar to it but its hot chocolate! i couldnt finish mine. on the other hand, the gugelhupf,a european style pastry, was delicious. it had hints of lemon and vanilla. the inside was soft while the outside had a soft crunch to it. it came with a side of whipped cream which was the perfect amount of sweet.i went there solely for hot chocolate but i wouldnt order that again. however, the dessert was a hit!"
Bullfinchs,5,customer service horrible ! soda was gross was watery and the sandwiches the advertised on the window they didnt have the bread and would compinsate! i bought a sanxwhich anyway it was good but i paid 7 dollars for half a sandwich and a drink that was gross

Espresso Pizza,1,little bit of a wait guess they were busy with the drivethru dont go there very often for a burger and a fry for the price i choose to go and get a meatball chicken cutlet parm or a italian sub for the same price. for what they charge for one of there  meals.89 for chicken sandwich or a cheeseburger with fries that are usually overcooked or cold. i think its a healthier choice to hit the sub store. drivethru meals and only choices a burgers and thin little patties might find them quite expensive
Kashmir Restaurant,5,"food is apparently halal, steak was on point"
100X100 DELICIAS,5,"translated by google highly recommended restaurant on the edge of bostons chinatown. even on a saturday night you get a little wait with a table while you have to wait at the mexicans up to 4 hours. you get a number and after a while a table assigned.the wait is worthwhile though. you get great food, large portions and the prices are for bostener ratios really cheap. you also get fancy dishes such as pork feet. originalabsolut empfehlenswertes restaurant am rand von bostons chinatown. selbst an einem samstagsabend bekommt man mit ein bichen wartezeit noch einen tisch whrend man beim mexikaner bis zu 4 stunden warten muss. man bekommt eine nummer und nach einer weile einen tisch zugewiesen.das warten lohnt sich allerdings. man bekommt tolle gerichte, groe portionen und die preise sind fr bostener verhltnisse wirklich gnstig. man bekommt auch ausgefallene gerichte wie zum beispiel schweinefe. "
Lolita Back Bay,5,2 or may be 3 ppl can eat in 5bucks!! great value for money! 
El Peñol,5,"since its opening this remains one of my favorites. they are known for their oysters and lobster rolls for good reason, although that shouldnt overshadow the other amazing menu items. they have a rotating beer selection that changes daily and is probably one of the best in the city, along with wine by the glass list that is also, in my opinion, one of the best as well. the south are all amazing, especially andrew at the bar. if youre going for the lobster roll, you can choose from a warm or cold one. i prefer a warm. the oyster selection is always good and never anything but fresh. finish it all off with the butterscotch pudding, which sounds basic but it is outrageously good."

Bohemios Restaurant & Bar,5,"food is good, chipotlestyle indian. but dear god are they slow. it is consistently a 20 minute ordeal every time we have been here. there is no reason for it...everything is premade and should be ready to go as you walk through. we even ordered online and walked over ten minutes after the pickup time and they clearly hadnt even started making it. it was an hour to get one order of vegetable dumplings. unfortunately, this was the last straw for me and i will not be back."

Mmmac N' Cheese,4,"what youve heard is right  reservations are nonexistent, so be prepared to either head there super early for dinner, or wait in line. but the lines worth it, if only for the mexican corn which, heres a secret you can ask to have scraped off the cob and served in a bowl and braised short rib. expect maginative dishes like peanut butter and jelly foie gras on toast with peanut brittle, or opt for more classic, but still flavorful spanish tapas, like the duck drumettes divine!. dessert options are few, but just enough dare you to have enough room to even order any."

Asian Garden Restaurant,5,quickly has become one of my favorite spots for dinner and drinks in south boston. i work nearby and on fridays this is my go to for an after work happy hour. the rooftop bar is awesome with a view of the harbor and of the airport. pretty solid playlist too. for dinner they have harborside seating options but basically anywhere will give you a nice view of the water. harpoon harborside is a must have and i loved the salmon burger. dont sleep on that raw oyster bar either.

@UNION,4,"come here somewhat often and it is always great. the food is always consistently delicious. i usually order the bone in rib eye which they always cook perfectly and it is so flavorful. their wine selection is amazing and if you know one or two you like the waiters will recommend great wines. the side dishes are delicious especially the flemings potatoes, their version of au gratin. also love their chocolate lava cake that takes a little while to prepare so order in advance, but it is so worth the wait. the service has improved dramatically in recent visits and this latest one was above and beyond my expectations with my drink never being empty and we never had any dirty plates or silverware on the table. highly recommend this place for a classic steakhouse meal thats slightly cheaper than other wellknown steakhouses."

Great Taste Bakery & Restaurant,5,"translated by google used while waiting for jal7 flight for narita at logan airport terminal e on march 10, 2017.its a simple donut shop that doesnt change, but in the first place, terminal e is dedicated to international flights and overseas airlines.therefore, the 2nd floor of the departure floor is quiet, there is no need to prepare an eatin space separately, and as soon as it is filled with a lonely atmosphere.however, i had no chance to enter dunkin in boston, so i was very happy to eat donuts just before returning to japan.thats because haruki murakami often writes praises for dunkin donuts in essays, so i wanted to use anything, so when i found it at the end of the last i was nervous went upi bought mineral water with a donut, but when i went to the security inspection station without drinking a bite, i was told to discard it or drink it now, either way lets face down.original17310ejal7e2f"

Sterling’s,5,good ft. ood
Marlborough Super Buffet,4,"the staff here moves as fast as they can but the one thing if there was any to complain about is the slow service with the cocktails. not sure if it was because these were some serious creative cocktails or what but the time from one to the next was long, almost too long. dessert was forgetful and needed work, could do without the greek donuts and chocolate twinkie"
Uno Pizzeria & Grill,5,"this place is a hidden treasure! i was so confused walking up the stairs to find the restaurant but once i had the food i was blown away! you have to try this place regardless if you are a vegan, vegetarian, or what ever! its also great for larger groups! this place has some great options! check it out!"

Casa Verde Taqueria,5,better customer service.
Papa John's Pizza,1,"ive been here a few times and finally got around to the review. this place gets packed! i usually try to come before it opens and youll be in their initial first wave. otherwise you usually have to wait till 7308 for their second wave to get seated. the good is all the veggie options, fish cake options and noodle options. the buffet items are pretty good i must say. they also have a plethora of ingredients for you to make your own sauce. in terms of meats and seafoods thats a la carte. its not too expensive but doesnt beat the all you can eat places around as it can add up if your getting 3 plates plus. one time i came and there was no watercress and that was pretty disappointing. to finish it off i recommend their green tea soft serve as its delicious!"

Steve's Greek Cuisine,5,"my fianc took me here for my 21st birthday and i got the lobster pasta that has been raved about by reviewers. can confirm  the pasta is delicious!! super creamy but not overwhelming and large chunks of tender lobster meat. the hype is not for nothing! oysters were also very yummy,  we only had a half dozen because we dont have very big tummies but what we did have we just asked for their recommendation of oysters that were more sweet and less briny as my fianc is not the biggest fan of shellfish were very tasty and pleased the picky eater bf."

McDonald's,5,sitting in cafe as i write this after reading the other reviews. food is amazing. duck buns and beef cabbage dumpling are to die for. this food is worth any cold drafts from the door opening and closing. it is so worth anything you have to do to get the food including parking issues. you want mouth watering melt in your mouth heaven pay the price and stop whinning.

Kayuga,4,"translated by google favorite seafood in the brand new beautiful area of boston. be sure to book, otherwise you will have to cram on the ground floor, but even there the impressions of the food are the best! in the evening there to sit with friends or on a date, thats it! pleasant waiters. also right there you can buy fish by weight, and then cook it at home.the second time i managed to get to the second floor  the atmosphere there is luxurious! great service! i ordered pasta with lobster and scallops  the lobster is delicious, but the scallops are stale, fu. in our primorsky territory, serving old scallops is a crime. especially for the price. snacks, wine, dessert were on the level.original       .  ,      ,         !          !  .        ,     .         !  !        ,    , .           .     . , ,    ."

Mumbai Spice,3,"this is a restaurant that i have previously enjoyed but today it was an incredible disappointment.  i got the special, a fish sandwich and a cup of chowder.  it was not very good.  the crust on the fish was seriously over seasoned and it overwhelmed the light white fish.  the chowder was tasteless.  my sons dish came with two poached eggs that were still slimy.  rendering the rest of the dish uneditable.  our calamari appetizer was greasy and bland unless you are the plethora of hot peppers.  the manager did remove my sons dish from the billthe waitress was a ghost."

Lunch Box Deli,5,"we had delicious breakfast on a saturday morning. nice coffee, nice service."

Banyan Bar + Refuge,5,it truthfully pains me to give this place 2 stars so i will be very detailed. the staff were friendly and seemed extremely accommodating with my vision for my daughters birthday. i wanted a large platter with ice cream waffles churros and everything sweet brought out to her for her birthday. they agreed to do it over the phone as long as i purchased the platteri had a party of 11 and  everyone had an issue with the food. small portions for mediocre food. we ordered alcoholic drinks and two sips later the drink was gone the cup was filled with ice not to mention the mojito glass was tiny. i asked the waiter to take some ice out and give me more drink like ice was literally falling out the cup it was so much in it. they charged me extra for this. again over priced fooddrink horrible portion size or nasty food.the waiter wasnt attentive to our half eaten food or cleared plates they sat there for a while and we asked her to clear them and ultimately we brought it to someone elses attention and they assembled a team to clear our plates.once they brought out my daughters platter it was not even close to what i wanted they gave us little to no ice cream i mean the ice cream was in a little condiment cup. they also tried to put the platter infront of the wrong kid i had to yell in the middle of the happy birthday song the birthday girl is right here. we didnt even get one full scoop of ice cream. i just wish for the 300 dollars i spent the experience was better. i did not feel good after spending my daughters birthday there.

The Elephant Walk,4,"i love this place for super authentic chinesestyle roast meats and hong kong style dishes like wonton noodle soup, bbq pork noodles, sauteed veggies, fried rice, noodles, etc. its a pretty small restaurant with not a lot of seating, so it can get crowded around peak meal times. service is very nofrills, but thats pretty typical for chinatown. great for a meal to share with friends, especially if they havent had hk style food, or to meet with family."

Noodle Lab,4,"in life there are certain places that will stand out to you forever, this is one of those places. we received warm greetings, smiles and jokes right as we walked in. we were offered drinks right away at no extra charge. my husband ordered a seafood dishes and because they were out of shirmp, they doubled up on all of the other fish. the rest of our food was fabulous and they offered my youngest daughter who had a very basic dish, seconds. the bread was flowing to our table non stop. did i mention the food was absolutely incredible. and in the end the friendliness made us feel like family. we so totally wish we  could bring them back to california with us."

Orfano,5,"good drinks and food, nice patio to hang out on"
The Tap Trailhouse,5,"this instagram sensation of a taiyaki shop chain actually lives up to the hype.   small with standing room only counters, the staff works at a brisk pace to keep the lines of opening weekend moving.  nice and clean modern decor keeping in line with the seaport habitat.  but what about the food?i can safely say that the taiyaki pastry itself is quite delicious.  freshly made, crispy exterior, and amazing eggy flavor.  an egg like flavor similar to chinese egg tarts.  yes, this is a bit different from sweet taiyaki pastries found at other places.  the toppings also were neatly placed for that crucial instagram picture, which speaks true about the smiling staffs dedication for the product.though i do have to deduct one star.  i ordered a straight outta japan taiyaki for a total of 8 dollars.  its a bit on the pricey side for a snack that one would devour in 5 minutes time.  a nice treat for oneself on a warm day."

Crave Chinatown,5,the best brunch in town with live music
Tuscan Kitchen,4,"by far my one of my favorite italian restaurant in the world. great staff, lot of options with both food and alcohol and is situated in the great little italy neighborhood of boston. suggest getting a recommendation early in the day since it gets full pretty quickly, you can also go to al dente its sister restaurant which is right next to it and have the same kitchen so you will get the same service."

Double Chin Modern Asian Restaurant,5,unbelievable burgers and fries
Sweet Rice JP Thai Sushi,4,"food is nasty and rude people. i was charged once for delivery on my card late at night and the fraudulent delivery driver had collected cash from me again on a hushhush status without even reminding me that i had already paid. the very worst hole in the wall, that desperately needs to be removed. and the people that are giving this place 5 star ratings are surely doing so by mistake because there is no way this place ever had that many people or great food there. not a chance."

Rosa Mexicano,5,delicious ice chocolate!
Sixth Gear - Cask & Kitchen,4,"forget to take pics of foods, only have desserts. overall experience is overpriced, not very worth it. the gnocchi is okay but very littlelook like the size of the dessert and only one level just covered the middle of the plate. the chicken is good but they put too too much salt. the pasta is hard and salty. desserts are good but overall lunch costed us 2.5 person 90 with one person still hungry.neither of us are over 160 poundsthe reason i give 2 stars is because i would like to deduct 1star for foods, one star for pricey and one star for services. the services here is friendly with smile but super slow without many guests actually very few people and many waiters, when we were there. we spent tons of time waiting for waiter to serve menu, waiting for him to come back and order, and waiting for checks. the how is everything goes doesnt help change my view of the service at all.this comment might be personal but will never try again."
La Summa,5,"lobster tail appetizer slightly overcooked. but lunch entrees were more successful. ordered tuna sandwich cooked to rare, and thats exactly what i got. seasoning could be a bit more aggressive. but better underseasoned  adjustable than overseasoned  inedible. would definitely go back again for another try."

Coda,4,"conveniently located at the base level of a building containing a movie theater and kings bowling  arcade. as such, you would normally question how well and clean things are kept. the place was orderly despite solid traffic mid afternoon on a saturday. i had a crepe paired with an aviation cocktail. the liquor is a bit bootleg as its a cordial license. so long as you can get creative with flavored spirits, youll enjoy yourself. classic crepe all the way."
Papa John's Pizza,5,beef lamb plate is great.
McGreevy's Boston,4,great place to grab a slice on a night of drinking

Luke's Lobster Downtown Crossing,5,monday deals are awesome!

Papagayo,3,"typical brazilian restaurant. the buffet is rich, i tried most of the food in it and enjoyed it all. they come and serve the meat at the table whenever your sign is green. they have over 15 different kinds of meat of beef, chicken, lamb and bacon. as for the price, i would consider it expensive for this type of food as we paid around 70 per person!"

McGreevy's Boston,5,great wings!!!!
Chumlee's,3,my every week spot!!
Cafe Jaffa,3,"we tried again because paani used to be our favorite restaurant.  we went there for birthdays and special occasions.  after our initial experiences in their sudbury location, see below  that rating was one star  we hadnt been back in over a year.  tonight we tried again takeout.  first the soup.   we had mulligatawny and the coconut tomato.  and what we had  of it it comes in 4oz quantities we could have done without.  unremarkable, salty, watery 1.50 per ounce.  i recommend skipping the experience.  considering that the  best mulligatawny i ever had was at paani years ago disappointing.the lamb samosas were lovely, crisp and  well seasoned.  if you have to be at panni, have these.  the railway goat curry had a nice flavor, but was very fatty, and what could be discerned of actual goat meat was very slight and overwhelmed by bones, gristle and fat.  nice flavor, but i dont feel better having eaten it.the chili mushroom appetizer  could have provided the oil for the whole meal.  the first taste was interesting, but the flavors were kind of odd and with the heaviness, i ended up not finishing it.  the naan  we had the onioncoriander one  was about what you would expect, also a little heavy and on the  doughy side.  all in all, not horrible, but also not a meal i would repeat.  upping my one star to two.from over a year ago i  have to agree with boris.  severely disappointed with my first experience at the new paani.  tonight we ordered takeout.  two of the 6 things we ordered were not right and the flavor was lacking in everything.  they substituted tandoori chicken for the chicken tikka we requested and paneer pakoras for the onion bhaji we ordered without any notification to us  neither had much flavor and both were rather dry.  also, i had looked forward to the soup i remembered from the old location.  tonights mulligatawny soup was too salty and simply not as flavorful as i had remembered.  the lamb samosas were dry and had no peas, or any vegetable.  the chicken tikka masala was okay, but not particularly good.  paani used to be our favorite indian place in all of the greater boston area.  not this paani."
L'Osteria,3,"the food is reliable and good across most branches of this chain, with generous portions for most of the menu. the service at this particular one, however, is really underwhelming, and i have been there quite a few times now. the salon is ample and there is lots of seating, so perhaps the waiter just loses track of the crowd. their cheesecakes are good and they offer pickup and delivery services. there is usually little waiting time."
Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse,5,my favorite dunkies i used to live near. they love to get your every day coffee memorized and make it just right.
Inna's Kitchen - Boston Public Market,4,"cute. colorful. huge portions. the best chili con queso ive ever had. delicious, strong margaritas. really great, fast service."
Citizen Public House & Oyster Bar,5,"sweetgreen is always solid. the location closer to downtown crossing is a little more efficient, but the salads are the same and the warm bowls are always delicious and filling. the spicy sabzi and harvest bowls are excellent."
The Pour House,5,we were waiting to be acknowledged for over 10 minutes..  tired of waiting we just left.
Tasty Burger,5,"tasted different than what were used to,but it was still ok,the meats were really dry."
Asian Garden Restaurant,4,the white rice and porki have not personally eating here but i take a ride in the morning every morning with a few friends and they stopped here every morning and if theyre stopping to eat here at 11 in the morning every morning that must tell you!
Mikey’s Famous Roast Beef & Seafood,5,"we came here for brunch. we were trying to find a spot that had a variety of options for both food and brunch inspired cocktails. we ordered the odb benedict which was really good and the chilaquiles which lacked substance and felt more like a breakfast appetizer with all the chips. we tried the mimosa flight,  a bloody mary, espresso and cucumber cocktail all of which had amazing flavors but tasted non alcoholic. we left the second round of drinks unfinished and were disappointed. we would come here again for the food and try different things but probably go with wine or beer. service was great, friendly and quick. overall experience was a 3 due to the cocktails lacking the sunday boozy brunch feeling."
Amrheins Restaurant,4,drinks. food. atmosphere........you have to go.

The Kitchen Café,3,first time here and the catfish was on.  raw oyster fresh and chilled.  i plan on returning.
Modern Underground,5,"incredible food, drinks, and good service too. ordered the octopus twice because it was maybe the best wed had anywhere. the drinks were delicious and balanced, and the sauteed beef hummus was awesome too. my only complaint was that it was way too dark when we entered. our eyes got used to it eventually, but it was a little disorienting at first."
Sakura Japan,1,great vegan cheese option!!!

Bred Gourmet,2,a little pricey but really good!
Dunkin,4,such a great location and from other recommendations i tried this place. poor service with food being forgotten and not brought till the end of the meal. food was over salted as well. the manager was super apologetic and made it a lot better so i give them at least a 3 for that.
Il Molo,5,rice cakes were delish.  hefty hugo drink was too.
Caffe Lil Italy,3,best go to place fro healthy eat! love the fact that they keep in season veggies price are great and service is quick
Eataly Boston,5,"arguably and i do mean, my friends and i argue about it the best quick service burrito chain in boston.i really like their more unique burrito options like the lengua cow tounge, makes for a more differentiated offering than the usual chicken or steak at other burrito chains.heres the goto orderlengua or carnitas, super burrito, extra cheese, rice, refried beans, all toppings, sour cream, no guac get to that later, add jalapeos, add hot sauce. then get a side of tortilla chips and guac.boom! youll never be happier than that order."
Tenoch Mexican,5,great live music venue great food..
Acapulcos Mexican Family Restaurant & Cantina,5,"small, cozy location. great mexican food, including their signature tortas sandwiches.the meat choices are yummy i havent had a bad one yet. the tacos are also yummy and a good value.also look for their food truck, but bring cash for it."

Labaredas Brazilian BBQ & Bar,4,"the waitstaff were very nice and attentivebut the food was not good at all!picture free food that comes with cheap day trips.......100 times worse. then picture paying 25 per person. so disappointing. we should have read the reviews first... unfortunately the bad ones are on point. bland, flavorless, poor quality..."

Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery,5,quick bit and great service.
Winsor Dim Sum Café,4,"brunch was damn good with a damn fine burger, juicy and salty and perfectly cooked and the best hash i can remember eating. the cocktails were alright, not bad but nothing grabbed me. wait staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.its cool looking place with high ceilings and every wall is covered with evocative local photographs.i encourage you to check it out."
Cósmica,5,im in dunkin donuts every day! good coffee and food is bomb
Fugakyu Cafe,5,"from what i saw, there are two options for bun mi the special combination see pic and beef bbq. the special combination was good, though not better than the bun mi from vietnam specially bun mi 25 from hanoi. each sandwich cost 4.50, which i feel is a tad bit much esp. on a grad school budget , but others might disagree. they add the picked carrots and radish, cucumbers, parsley, pate, and the butterlooking spread. they will add jalapeos, unless you dont want it spicy. it has a good about of saltiness and flovour to it. would definitely recommend if youre in the area."
El Centro Mexican Restaurant,5,tasteless

The Glenville Stops,5,"made a reservation on opentable for 1230pm and wasnt seated until past 1245. normally i could understand, as it was a bit busy, but the hostess seated multiple walkins before us and then offered us a table in the cafe seating section that had been open for more than 15 minutes. when asked for a different table, we were seated at a slanted table in a location that resulted in staff bumping against our seats constantly.the food the burrata and tomato confit needed salt.  the burger i had was fine, but not worth 17. the fig  prosciutto pizza and the cuban sandwich were also good. however, the cider donuts tasted like entenmanns.the drinks the bloody mary was fine, but small and not worth 12. the tiger lily was good, but again, small and expensive.edit 1092018hi cm,thanks for reaching out both here and on opentable. im not sure what details you are interested in, but im more than happy to post those details here.while it may be that the staff of sonsie may be able to provide truly wonderful service the issue is that the service was not even close to adequate during my visit. between the hostesses and the wait staff, not to mention my impression of the food and drinks, i hope you can understand why i decline your invitation to visit sonsie again.best,rico"
North 26,3,"came here for dine out boston recently. my husband and i had heard good things about this place and it had good reviews online, unfortunately our experience was just average and not even worth the restaurant week price. first, the bread, which is always  a good marker of whats to come, was below average. for starter my husband got the french onion soup which didnt have much flavor. i got the escargot which didnt have much flavor either considering its meant to be soaked in butter. i didnt even finish the bread that it came with to dip in the garlic butter since it didnt taste like garlic butter. for the entrees my husband got the steak frites, which was okay. he said his steak was lukewarm by the time he got it. i got the beef wellington which was okay. and for dessert he got the butterscotch which he enjoyed and i got the box of truffles which were average. also i know the service can be subpar because things get busy during restaurant week, but the restaurant wasnt that full from what i could tell and yet one of the servers initially brought us someone elses entrees while we were still eating our appetizer. i also noticed the servers had mistaken some other peoples orders around me. overall just an average experience."

Liberty Bell,4,"just moved to the area, and i have to say, this place is new favorite brunch place!"
Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers,3,"this is the kind of place downtown crossing has been needing for decades. at lunch, it is a space for workers to get a quick sandwich plate or burger and maybe a surreptitious beer. then jmcurley really comes alive after work  it fills up instantly with people looking for an expertly made cocktail from an everevolving list of craft cocktails. the temple place gt  made with bark powder  is my favorite variation on the classic in the entire city. beer lovers arent left hanging either. a handful of taps, mostly from local brewers, always offer a variety to suit most palates  if not, their well selected bottle and can selection can definitely meet your needs. they also keep a chefs stock of 40s and tall boys for those days when thats what you really need, too.  food at dinner time includes a variety of tasty bar snacks. if the pretzels are on the menu, you need them. same can be said for the deviled eggs. the entree list on the printed menu is very small, but it is supplemented by a list of 7 weekly specials that change wait for it weekly. those specials always include a burger, a pbj, a flavored popcorn free!, as well as whatever chef monsour and his team have on their minds that week. this aint health food, folks, but its hearty, tasty as all hell, and meant to share. in a city that has gone burger crazy, jm curley offers 2 takes  a smaller flat griddled patty, and a large fat grilled patty  representing both of the major schools of burger thought. both are excellent and you will likely gravitate to the style you ordinarily prefer. for dessert get a boozy concrete  an ice cream based drink spiked with booze and often fun accouterments like raisins soaked in so much rum theyre damn near grapes again, and the skillet cornbread  a variation on the new england version of the bread that has a puddinglike consistency perfect for dessert. after the workcrowd rush, curleys is perfect for neighborhood denizens to stop in for dinner. then the place explodes again as restaurant workers get off shifts across the city, as, at its core, this is an industry hangout. any time after 10 youre likely to be rubbing elbows with the elite of the citys kitchens, just dont be a dbag about it, as ownership is committed to keeping this place as a safe haven for those looking for an escape from nightmare customers. that said, if youre not in the industry, you are treated as if you were, and that is a wonderful feeling in a neighborhood bar."

Halfway Cafe,5,"as you can tell from my photos, i was pretty disappointed with my meal. i usually choose this place for fresh fast vegetarian bowl. however today the lettuce was old and browning. im shocked that the staff was willing to serve unfresh products. before getting the food,  i waited in line behind 710 people for at least 15 minutes. it appeared to me that the staff there didnt really care about the customers. im not trying to be rude. i trully hope this will be taken as a constructive criticism."
Piccolo Nido,5,on a recent trip to boston we went in this particular starbucks for a hot chocolate and muffins.very attentive staff who struggled with my english accent but persevered.sat on a window bench overlooking the park entrance and people watched the bostonians walking their dogs .lovely way and place to spend an hour
Flatbread Company Brighton,5,"cosy and authentic polish atmosphere, very unique for boston. here you can try a real polish food with real polish ingredients. although the menu is mostly heavily loaded with meat, they still have nice vegetarian options. this cafe has soups every day all day long! they also serve polish alcohol, which is very interesting to try. here you can always hear some polish language and that adds its charm to this humble but big hearted place."
Il Molo,5,food was good
Abe & Louie's,4,"service was exceptional, the hostexpo made sure our very particular table was serviced properly, and triple checked on us throughout our meal. our server, charlie, did a phenomenal job checking allergies on menu items that werent actually listed on the allergen menu, the bread for sandwiches contains dairy even though its not listed fyi and substituting a few items to accommodate allergens. 4 stars because food was very pricey for portion size, although of very high quality and flavor albeit a bit over seasoned saltwise, and i am a moderate smoker so i use salt liberally. it was nice to see good brisket and catfish this far north, so its definitely worth a stop, especially if you have young children andor are breastfeeding as they are very good with family atmosphere. will visit again for sure next trip to the childrens museum."

Legal Sea Foods,5,"solas holds a special place in my heart as it was the place my husband and i went right after we got married. we wanted an informal and intimate wedding at city hall, and after taking our vows and taking a relaxed stroll through the commons, a thunder storm rolled in. we thought we could make it back to our car which was parked on mass ave without getting absolutely soaked. we were wrong, so we ducked into solas for a celebratory drink and to wait out the storm.  the staff laughed with us as we ran in looking like wet dogs in some nice clothes. they asked where we came from and we let them know that we had just gotten married. they treated us to champagne and dessert and held a cheers for us across the bar. we truly did not expect such special treatment. it was truly an unforgettable day. i  know that is a one off experience but i will never forget it.  on the regular day i will head into solas for delicious fish and chips, a guiness or an irish coffee on a cold day. it has a very comfortable feel and is a regular go to!"

Neighborhood Pizza & Pasta House,4,"food was great but service was terrible. i wanted to start a rewards card and they said they dont have those anymore. i proceeded to buy my 80 worth of sandwiches. after buying i asked why they dont do rewards anymore. the guy said we do them on the cell. i said let me download the app then. i downloaded the app and asked if he can put my order in the app to accumulate points. he said i needed to have done that before the purchase. i almost exploded. what a way to gain loyal customers. another thing is i ordered two jumbo lobster rolls and they turned out to be regular size when i got home. i was too far to walk back to get 13 back for the jumbo upgrade. so always check to see if they did their work right or else they may not do the upgrade right when youre taking out. i used to go to this location twice every week last summer. now i am super annoyed with their service. frankly the lobster roll at atlantic fish across the street is the same price and has super duper service, and uses more lobster!!!!!"
Chinatown Cafe,5,really good burgers and atmosphere. menu has a lot of options to choose from and you can even build your own.
Mare Oyster Bar,4,service was good. food was done in a descent timeframe. food was pretty good. the only is was i order my food to go... a patriots burger 13 and when i sit to  eat it at work no bread. how do you eat a burger without  bread. needless to say i cant add sauce or sides to it now. first time there ruined. come on guys.
Boston Seafood,4,great food and drinks! never disappointed.

Bristol Restaurant and Bar,5,"one of the best bartenders ever. excellent drinks, dessert, and ambience."

Max Brenner,3,"i love this place. their food is fantastic, offering both americanstyle chinese food and homestyle chinese. the service, however, is my favorite part of the experience. the staff treat you like family. theyre incredibly friendly, and greet you on entry every time. when i say i want takeout, im ushered to a table by who i believe to be the owner, handed and menu with a smile, and told to take my time. once, i forgot that they only do card transactions over 15, and they took my card anyway! i said i would be willing to add more to the order, and the nice woman said that she doesnt want me to order something i dont need. the atmosphere is like youre eating at home, which is a nice feeling. the prices are also very reasonable! this place is simply amazing, and i love coming here."

Hsin Hsin Cafe,5,"three stars, but almost five...the food was delicious, but we were seated without napkins and our server seemed averse to the idea of bringing any to the table until we were done with our soups and being served the entres. said server refilled my water glass but not either of my friends. we were provided no recommendations and the only friendly conversation that was made came with the check. for the money, you can do worse, but you can do vastly better within just a few blocks."

Skewers Wood Grill,5,excellent restaurant.
Pushcart Cafe & Pizzaria,3,my favorite summer restaurant when walking around castle island and along carson beach. ideal for sunday brunch or early dinner. skip sullivans and eat at local 149 to reward yourself after long beach walks with special someone. lamb burger or fish tacos for dinner with friends or choose one of the mains if on a date. eggs benedict or tuna burger for brunch. if you are tourist get the deep fried fluffernutter for a decadent dessert.

Phở Pasteur,5,"just glancing at the menu, i was pretty sure this place would be a step above the tired cookiecutter italian places that litter the neighborhood, and i was right.   the ricotta croccante appetizer of grilled bread and truffle honey with pressed ricotta cheese was out of this world, and our pasta dishes went far beyond the typical.   service was excellent and unhurried  im looking forward to going back with a group of friends so i can try more of this adventurous menu."
@UNION,5,highly recommend.  authentic and tasty food and very friendly staff.  owner is very nice!
Chill Kitchen and Bar,5,"piperis whole shtick is that everything is so fresh, that they dont even have a freezer.  thats all well and good, but at the end of the day, its the taste of the food thats far more important.and the taste... is pretty good.  but they have off days.  if it was more consistent, id gladly offer 4stars.  for example, some days the chicken is seasoned well and juicy, other days its dry with hard bits of cartilage.all of the toppings are great, and taste as they should.    feta tastes like... feta, tzaziki tastes like... tzaziki.. my favorite addition combo is the tangy moroccan carrots with the tzaziki.the line gets long, but goes fast with the assembly line setup.  the lower price partially makes up for the food inconsistency."
Bristol Restaurant and Bar,3,"the cannelloni alla trapanese was perfection. the pasta was paper thin and filled with pure deliciousness!  also ordered the tagliatelle with bolognese sauce, hearty and flavorful. the side of cannellini beans with shaved prosciutto and kale was a great compliment. i also had to try the cannoli of the day, a ricotta with dates and honeythe best cannoli ever! not cheap but my girlfriend and i shared the plates and everything was delicious."

Krazy Jakes,4,great service and cozy atmosphere.
Acapulcos Mexican Family Restaurant & Cantina,2,"friendly service and really fun desserts. small, but cozy and well decorated. i personally loved the plates and silverware as a restauranteur myself. shaved ices were perfect for a hot and humid boston day, and the strawberry milk shaved ice tasted just like strawberry nesquik. deeeeelish!"

Stephi's on Tremont,4,"there are no signs outside when i went to eat. i ended up walking past it a couple of times before realizing it. i made a reservation and i arrived just on time. i walked in its a small place with a handful of tables and told the waitress that i had a reservation. she told me that it would be 10 minutes and said to leave, walk around and then come back. at first i was taken aback, because of the way that she spoke to us. she was quite blunt and borderline rude. by the way, if you want to come during peak dinner times make sure you have a reservation because its a small place that fills up very quickly. at one point the waitress was turning people away who didnt have a reservation. after waiting it out we came back and were seated. we quickly realized that for such a tiny place, reservations were hard to keep on time so they did a reasonable job all things considered. after that we ordered our food. we got the stew with the mussels and that was delicious. it was a huge amount and im very happy that we split it in two. for the dinner we got the cherrystone clams linguini in white sauce and vegetable risotto. personally i preferred the linguini but i would happily take either one. the food was absolutely delicious. the dinner ended with the tiramisu which ive never had but my girlfriend has and she claimed that it was one of the best that shes ever tasted. overall it was a great experience and great food. now back to that waitress, she ended up being super nice and accommodating. she is blunt, and could come off as rude but her intentions are very good and i enjoyed having her as our waitress. i will definitely be coming back."
Bollywood Grill,5,nice place. good service. tasty drinks. trendy menu. very pleasant.
Tarboosh (Syrian shawarma & Manakish)شاورما عربي مناقيش مشاوي,5,"ill admit that i had high expectations for dorado tacos. overall it was very good, but i wasnt blow away. the food is fresh and tasty. however the chorizo was a little oily and underseasoned while the steak was a bit dry.the tacos are a good size and are filling and the corn tortillas are fresh and delicious.dorado tacos is a good option for mexican cuisine, but i wouldnt travel out of my way for it. however, it is one of the better options in the boston area."
The Point,5,"i love the octopus, it seems everything else is pretty middle of the road forgettable. but if you just need a lunch and you like octopus, this is a good choice. the chianti is good, too."

Tilted Kilt Pub and Eatery (Boston),5,the food was okay cant really complain for the price besides the chicken wing dinner which definitely was not worth 9. it came with a good amount of chicken and french fries but the chicken was freezer burnt... and the other people that i want with who ordered pizzas didnt even eat them so i dont know how the pizza was it didnt look like it tasted too good lol but the cook and server were nice. its definitely not a place to sit and eat theres only a few chairs end tables

The Oceanaire Seafood Room,5,"i utilized this location due to its proximity to the boston common where my walking group meets. the facility has two levels. the lower level has cashier, at least 3 double sided self kiosks, and a digital wall menu which is damaged on the right side, tables and chairs. the upper level has two bathrooms, tables and chairs. a side salad and medium iced coffee, no sugar and no cream was 3.83 a reasonable price. i did note the 400mg of sodium in the balsamic vinaigrette a little too much for me so i only used half the packet. it was relatively busy and i observed the various orders brought to customers. one particularly large order was served to a group of kids from all appearances they seemed to be on a school outing with their teachers.  i also observed the servers cleaning tables and sweeping floors at various times. from the observation of a person who has not utilized a mcdonald in years the self kiosks are definitely being used and appear to be quite effective."

Mi Pueblito Restaurant,4,"very disappointed by how rude the young guy with purple painted nails was in pavement today.  ordered a sandwich, i commented on the price being higher than i thought, but was fine with it.  he canceled my order without saying anything at all and then asked me to leave if i wasnt going to order anything.  i was kind of shocked and confused because i had literally just ordered something.  i come in here a lot and always tip.  will not be tipping going forward because the girl who made my sandwich threw it on the counter aggressively too.  this was friday, december 18th at 220 pm.  note that because of the snow storm there were no other customers and i felt like i was an annoyance to them. very unprofessional."

Haymarket Pizza,5,"i was excited to try italianstyle dishes in tiny, easy to share portions. i was also curious about this place having just met the lovely guy that supplies the olive oil to the restaurant at sowa.first things first. the service was super european style. the waitress needed to be flagged down to get service. it was a beautiful night to sit outside so it didnt bother me too much.what did bother me was the fact that they were out of 23s of their menu. but still, i was sad i didnt get to try the infamous aracino balls, asparagus, or tuna. and my friend really wanted the chicken liver crostini, but nope, another strike out.i did order the pesto and farro, which i cant complain. ive had farro before and tried cooking with goose berries, which are the most impossible grains to make flavorful. or so i thought, until having the one at coppa, which tasted almost pickled to perfection.we also ordered cocktails, which the waitress graciously wrote off of our bill because she felt bad for the lack of menu items. allinall not an awful experience. i only hope the next time i come in they will have more of their entrees."

Boston Pizza & Seafood,5,"a friend and i were walking around the north end one weekend and stopped into carmelinas for a quick lunch. they fortunately had a table for us with no wait. since i am not a big pasta eater, my eyes darted quickly to the main course menu. the stuffed center cut pork rib chop stuffed with smoked mozzarella and prosciutto and topped with roasted garlictomato sauce caught my eye and i had to have it. dang this was delicious and filling. the pork chop was perfectly seared, the cheese oozed out, and i sopped up every last bit of sauce with the bread on the table and i dont even eat bread often either!.this was my first north end italian restaurant but wow does it make me excited to try more."

Krazy Jakes,5,"im sad i did not find bebop sooner. its a fantastic barrestaurant that has a solid menu of irish fare, great beverages, and awesome live music. i love that they have performances every day of the week.the stew was hearty and loaded with lamb chunks, potatoes, carrots, and onions. to help eat the broth, they gave three toasted crostinis which were awesome. the service here is lovely. id highly recommend stopping in for a pint and listening to the music if youre in the area!"
New Style Asian Food,5,the food was disgusting!a drink is more than enough... they forgot our coke and one of our dishes. the interior had his prime time in the 80ies. 2 stars because the waiters tried to be friendly at least they seem understaffed and tired and the view is obviously amazing!
Dunkin',5,the food is made for nonvietnamese
Sky Restaurant,5,amazing fresh gluten free pasta!
Halal Indian Cuisine,5,"the shrimps were way too cooked, felt like a chewing gum. the potatoes were ok, the duck was dry and the fish had way too much curry. the bone marrow and toast were soaked in fat and oil i know it is supposed to be fat but that was too much. to be fair the octopus was great. the price wasnt cheap, to which they added a 3 service fee and 6 covid fee. apart from that, they hardly had any warmers out. very disappointing way to celebrate our tenth anniversary. given the good reviews i assume the main reason for our bad experience was the fact we had to sit outside on what they call the patio which are simply tables on the sidewalk. i assume this hurts their ability to provide good service and deliver food on time before it gets cold."
75 on Liberty Wharf,5,i loved the service and the food was great
Red Lantern Restaurant & Lounge,5,best chinese food in eastie always was and always will be good is always fresh.
Capo Restaurant & Supper Club,4,"considering yard house is a chain, this place is pretty good! their schtick of selling beer in yard glasses has been overplayed for 20 years, but their beer selection is hard to beat. try the sushi cake appetizer. if youre there during a sox game, stop by afterwards. its crazy packed, but you can usually get a table or a seat at the bar."

Wayland Pizza House,3,food was fresh and well proportioned!
Paradise Biryani Pointe,3,the place was empty at 8pm with half of the tables with the chairs on top like it was closing. 3 tables had empty plates because they were never cleaned for the time we were there. we had to wait almost an hour for our food even though there was nobody else there. bathroom was all messed up. but after the long wait the food was fresh and hot. except for the sizzling plate lacking the sizzle...
Jumbo Grill & Pizzeria,5,"way, way, way over priced.  exceedingly small portions right down to the barbecue sauce. i ordered a 27 plate that came wrapped in a piece of brown butcher paper the spare no expense on the to go containers lol my 27 3 meat plate came with 2 pork ribs approximately 2 and a 12 inches long each with very limited meat, 1 piece of  beef brisket that was about 40 fat and 2  slices of smoked turkey that were maybe 12 inch thick by maybe 7 inches long. the flavor of the meats were acceptable for a barbecue joint but nothing special the turkey in particular was very dry as was the pork ribs.usually having dry meat at a barbecue place isnt such a big deal because you can slather it with sauce the only problem was they literally gave you about three thimbles full of their sauces, which by the way were not very good at all anyway.usually one of my favorite vegetables to get at a barbecue place are the collard greens so i got a double order of the collard greens, then instantly regretted it, they were missing that smokey beacon flavor that i have come to love. i had a choice of 3 sides so i am going lo carb so i ordered the zucchini salad which i could not even finish i literally took one bite of it and threw the rest away parbul flavor combinations with dry pasty cheese.the size of the sides was embarrassing as well imagine a small disposable plastic cup filled about 13 of the way and then cut the rest off and put on a cover, thats how much you got with each side.so over all i can truly say that i have never been more disappointed in a restaurant experience."
Joe’s Waterfront,1,"tasty and quick, menus on the walls note, the price of gyros is no  ."

"The White Bull Tavern | Boston's Best Comedy, Nightclub, Restaurant",5,"a classic steakhouse menu. i felt like the restaurant is super overhyped. ive eaten at much better steakhouses even chain steakhouses. for the quality of the food i feel like it is overpriced as well. i dont mind paying premium prices for the best steaks, however i didnt feel like these are worth the price. tried the pork chop and it was good. didnt have a bad experience but just feel like the reputation of the restaurant does not match up with the food i received. the service was pretty good, but again not up to par with other steakhouses that ive been to."

Buffalo Wild Wings,5,good chicken gyro. they put a lot of onions ask for less
Liquid Art House,5,"i ordered the impossible burger and fries. the burger itself and the fries were good, but the caramelized onions were a big miss. they were cooked to the point of being an indistinct mush, and were congealed and cold on top of the burger. unappetizing and cemented to the top so i couldnt take them off.i waited at the online pickup spot as directed, but the workers working the front ignored me for 10 minutes, until i caught their eye for longer than a second. the bag sitting behind them the whole time turned out to be my order. it seems like its supposed to go in the shelves i have access to, but they never put it there."

Energize,5,randomly picked this place for my 4 year anniversary. didnt know it was a nightclubrestaurant. food was amazing. drinks were amazing. could use a decor make over and they seemed to be having some sort of party right next to us in the corner with a table of 10 and they were talking loudly so that was the only downside. music had me jamming. i would defiantly come back.
"Explorateur Cafe, Restaurant & Bar",1,"i loved the food! theyre very fast in bringing out the food. good environment. very cozy and traditional. even though ive been a local in this neighborhood for so long, i had never heard of this place. im so happy i discovered this place through seated, i will definitely be back! recommended tom yum kung soup, drunken noodles, papaya salad, stirfried veggies and more!"

Legal Sea Foods,4,"weve eaten here many times.  it is one of our goto places around fenway park.  the food is great, the beer selection is pretty good, and the service is decent.  this time, however, the beer selection was less than we expected as the cooler for the draft system was out.  after selecting a draft beer and being told that wasnt available, i chose a canned beer.  a few minutes later i was told they were out of that, too.  third time was, indeed, the charm.  the food was as good as always.  do not pass up the biscuits!i would have loved to give them 5 stars.  the service, in this case, prevents me from doing so.  there was no line and we were immediately seated unusual following a sox home game.  quite a long time passed without speaking to a waiterwaitress.  we flagged down a passing waitress and she went off to find ours.  more minutes passed.consider this my gift to restaurants  seat the customer and get drinks in front of them as quickly as humanly possible!  thatll give you a few minutes to get to their food order should things be extra hectic."

La Parrilla Restaurant,4,"wed been here before and not particularly impressed, but we tried takeout this time again last night.  i have to say the service was fine and  the food was pretty good. we ordered lamb samosas, malai chicken and the lamb biryani.  the naan was nice and the other dishes tasty  the heat was as requested but the authentic indian spices a bit muted.  only one big problem, the lamb samosa was so very salty to be almost inedible. we both agreed it was not just a little too much  it was truly an assault on our senses.   without this, i would have given them a 4  wed love to see soul of india fix this."

1000 Degrees Pizza Salad Wings,3,"if you are craving something fast, greasy,  and delicious, this is the place to go.  they have some really creative sandwichesburgers, and are willing to do some offmenu stuff ie curly fries with cheese sauce.  would be five stars if they took credit, not sure if it has changed since ive been."
Artu On Charles Street,4,"this review does not take into account the ambience in any way because it is being written in the covid 19 pandemic, and restaurants are allowed patio seating only. it looked like they had a limited menu during the pandemic, which is also not a reason for my two star review. my husband and i ordered a total of 4 tacos blackened mahi, shrimp, lobster, and pork belly, 2 cocktails, and chips and guac between the two of us. our bill was 70 plus tip each single taco was about 13 bucks which is very expensive given the sub par food. the mahi taco was smelly and the dressing tasted funny, indicating that is was not fresh. the lobster and pork belly tacos were fine. the shrimp taco had an overbearing dressing which took away from the shrimp. the drinks were terribly sweet and had very little to no alcohol in them. very expensive for the poor quality food. will not come again."
The Daily Catch Waterfront,5,great beer selection and awesome service! a rare unchanged gem with a local vibe.
Al Dente Ristorante,4,"good ambience. very good food. excellent cocktails and margaritas. i was here with my friends celebrating friday, and we had a blast. the portion size was decent, and prices reasonable. i would recommend the loaded nachos, they were delicious. the waitress served us long island on special request even though they didnt have it on the menu. customer service 100100. highly recommend this spot!"

Mirchi Nation-Indian Kitchen,5,food was really tasty and good service
Boston Bay Pizza 3,4,"tldrwendys is great! staff is awesome! food was tasty! accessibility issues are present.wendys is a personal favorite when i need to eat quick. the food was good as always, but i was sad to see that most of the first floor seating was stools. there was a very low and uncomfortable table, but the nicer seats where really only available by stair or elevator. i would say they where in complaince, and the 2 level, one floor for kitchen and wait line  one for guest, fast food restaurant model works pretty well.my main complaint is that if the kitchen is under the guest floor bathrooms are usually above them for making it easier to run all the water pipes for plumbers. this puts them on the second floor, all the way in the back. stairs or elevator, both available, are nessecary to use it.so if a person comes in needing to use the bathroom, they buy something, the elevator is out, they have a walker, what do they do? its not on the restuarant, legally, to help them.the workers could get fired for helping this person up the stairs. the doors sometimes have pincodes to get in, so you might have bought something for the right to use it before realizing you can not. you do not have the right to ask for a refund in that case.again good food, clean store, great staff."

Pushcart Cafe & Pizzaria,5,"this afternoon i visited boloco on 176 boylston st. near to the boston common, for your 23rd anniversary.  all week it has been  advertised to get our 1997 pricing for 4.97. today is  friday 228  and todays menu was advertised as goloco  you do you.  i decided to do me, as suggested, and instead of the 4.97 that i was supposed to be changed, i was charged 10.00 for ordering the summer and not creating my own signature bowl or burrito.  they refused to honor the pricing that is stated on the website and in their store. there is nothing on your website that states that a patron must create a bowl that is not available on the menu. i feel that this advertisement is grossly false and underhanded, but decided it wasnt worth the argument, so i paid the price and went back to my office to eat.  unfortunately i was disappointed further when i found that the mango salsa was tasteless and a bit slimy.  i understand that mango is not in season, however, if something doesnt taste good because its not in season, i would discourage the sale of it.  on any other occasion  i probably would have just groaned and scraped off the bad parts because of being pressed for time, however i decided i wasnt going to be had 2x in one sitting, so i brought it back.  i didnt request to be refunded, however i changed my entire order and they nicely obliged.   most visits there are appropriate, nothing above and beyond, just appropriate.  but theyve dropped a star in my book because of this incident."

Longwood Grille & Bar,4,"rude people except for 1 or 2 girls. they wont give u a regular styrofoam cup. i asked for a ice macchiato and it looks like they only put 1 shot of espresso in. this happened last time i came as well. ive worked at dunkin donuts, i know how a macchiato shld look and taste. especially since i get 2 a day. if im paying almost 5 dollars for a coffee i expect it to be made right. this dunks is below subpar."

Mezcala Tex Mex Grill,4,"hostess was friendly, and the inside is clean and inviting, but our table for two was tiny, and there was a very rowdy group at the bar who were swearing and yelling loudly, and were allowed to carry on, seemingly without being asked to keep it down.  service was slow, and our waitperson fairly unattentive took too long to catch her attention for drinks, check, etc.  food was cooked appropriately, but just bland and unexciting, especially for the prices.   my daughter  had enjoyed her last visit here, so i was definitely hoping for better, but was disappointed."

Tandoori Grill,5,"great food.  great drinks.  tough service tho.  hostess was great.  bartenders x 4 was running like a machine.  soon as we grabbed a table that great experience stopped.  missing waitress, another one stepped in the take charge and saved the day w drinks, to tide us over.  never made it to the food round before the show at agganis.  unfortunate start to our night."

Viga,5,"1 a 16 oz 45 day dryaged prime ribeye.69.50 excluding tax. 1010.medium rare pink throughout. nice marbeling with a great balance of fat and juicy, tender meat.side of peppercorn sauce  compliments the steak nicely. dont add too much or else the pepper can be overpowering. had this same steak twice in my life and its consistent every time. definitely recommend the dryaged!2 shellfish plateau chilled alaskan king crab legs, iced jumbo shrimp, chilled crab claws, and oysters.side of chilled lobster cocktail and lump crab louie.overall rating 810.all seafood was fresh. didnt have that fish aftertaste. tender and wasnt obnoxiously chewy.the king crab legs were already semipreopened and thus, you only have to open up the case to get the meat. very little work to open it up and it doesnt get too messy.oysters were good  definitely use a squeeze of lemon to enhance the flavor.the crab claws were small but there were at least 15 of them. each claw had a lot of meat. opening the claws can be slightly difficult and you might need to use the shellfish cracker.side of lobster cocktail was okay  fresh cold lobster without any seasoning with bits of corn.the side of crab louie was good  its mixed with mayo and very tender!3 lobster mac  cheese  the best ive ever had. creamy but not too overwhelming. lobsters were fresh. although there werent a lot of lobster  maybe a few tiny pieces here and there which was disappointing. the crust topping wasnt stale and gave the mac  cheese and nice added texture. definitely recommend! 910.4 uptown potatoes  melted fontina, chives and shaved truffle. the cheese was a little cooled down and the potatoes could have been softer and more seasoned. it was creamy but couldve been better. 510.5 brussel sprouts  fresh and well seasoned. not too oily and not too bitter. 710.6 not pictured creamed spinach delicious! and 100 recommend and seasonal asparagus tall, soft, but still had the nice crunch, and well seasoned. would recommend!.7warm banana bread pudding w caramel sauce  vanilla ice cream. 11.50  delicious, warm, light, and moist. you can taste the fresh bananas in every bite and the bread pulls apart nicely. ice cream is a nice touch. 100 recommend and would get it again! 1010.8 butter cake w butter pecan ice cream, fresh whipped cream  caramel sauce. 12  cake was a little too dry but the taste was very good. couldve used more caramel sauce but the ice cream tasted phenomenal! 810.9 lemon cake  6 layers with lemon buttercream icing  lemon glaze. 13  strong lemon flavor without being too overwhelming. moist but heavy and very sweet. but the size is very generous and can definitely be shared among 35 people. 710.10 cheesecake with strawberry sauce  pecan crust. 11.50  very creamy and slightly heavy but delicious with the strawberry sauce. couldve use more crust which was delicious. 810.11 chocolate souffle cake  warm molten center chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and raspberry purree. 12.50  the description on the menu makes it sound like a lava cake but its actually a mousse dessert. it was absolutely delicious and i would get it again but slightly disappointed because the description was misleading. i also could not taste any of the raspberry in the mousse cup and there couldve been more cake. taste 910 but very misleading which needs to be fixed!"

O Ya,5,"i really had been looking forward to this place just for the history alone.  its situated among the busy streets in boston but not too hard to find.  decor is what you would expect, with history lessons built in.  very neat atmosphere.  thats where the excitement for visiting the oldest restaurant in the country stops.  server was very slow, and non attentive.  we had to keep asking for drink refills because he wouldnt do it on his own or ask and their glasses were really small and the soda was very watered down.  fried seafood platter was very small considering the price, and the batter was gummy and flavorless.  the lobster roll did have a lot of meat in it, however it had a lot of trash meat and cartilage, and tons of shell pieces.  overall, neat experience, but, not worth eating at.  way over priced for what you get."

Wing's Kitchen,4,"i went here for a friends birthday outing on a saturday night knowing what we were getting into giant crowds, lots of dancing and top 40 music, and lots of drinks. this place was just right for what kind of night we were expecting, but the crowd is pretty young college aged. the pub grub was good  we ordered some loaded waffle fries  and though it was packed, our waitress still managed to be attentive."

7 Nana Japanese Steakhouse,5,"wendys used to be my favorite fast food chain from 3 burger options. recently went to the drive thru of this specific wendys. 20 minute wait to get to the order window, no ordering ahead and when i finally got my order, i specifically asked if there were straws in the bag, and the person having me my order replied yes and then when we drove off and opened the bag, no straws, no sauces for the fries,they gave us a dr pepper instead of a diet coke and one sandwich was missing. i know that its not really wendys fault, but that experience made me to not want to go to any wendys ever again. and even before the pandemic, this place used to be slow at the drive thru, but after this... wendys no more for me.update after ordering through grubhub a few timesevery time i preorder wendys they are late. like at least half an hour late. the whole point of the preorder is so your order gets there first thing so it can be on time. if you go to their drive thru, you have to make sure you preorder on the app and choose the curbside because if you get there and their drive thru has more than 5 cars very frequent, you are looking at 20 minutes wait minim. also they only have 2 spots for pickup and last time i was there, a couple was sitting in their car eating their order without changing space..those are only pickup spots and with only 2 you might get there and not have anywhere to park to get your order. now the couple waiting was not wendys fault..but only 2 spots? all they have to do is make signs for 2 more right next to them in case other idiots decide to stay in that spot and eat without moving first. slow service, frequently mix up orders, the only thing keeping that place open is that they are the only wendys around for miles!i keep giving them a chance cause occasionally im in the mood for wendys..especially since you eat the same drive thru every time during covid...every drive thru has upped their game with covid..not wendys in norwood"
Mi Rancho,5,fun for the first time and the food tastes great. but the cost is outrageous.

Bar Mezzana,4,"this place was just okay though perhaps i have too high of standards being middle eastern. the hummus was bland, couldve used more lemon juice and salt. the pickled turnips couldve used a bit more tangy bite to them. they didnt serve the sandwich with a garlic sauce. the bread was good but not mind blowingly amazing.their food is quick, light, and not terrible. i might find my way back again, but i dont know. clover, being just around the corner and also offering pita sandwiches, might lure me away."

Woody's Grill & Tap,4,good food for a decent price
Terra at Eataly Boston,5,came in here during their winter dine out boston lunch menu.  the service was great from start to finish.  i was seated promptly for my reservation and offered to check my coat.  the dine out boston menu had at least 1 vegetarian options for each course and i started with the leek soup.  it came out quickly and had a very creamy texture with a crispy waffle cut chip in the center for some crunch.   the soup came out lukewarm but would have been much better if it was slightly warmer.  for the 2nd course i choose catavelli with broccoli rabe.  it also came out lukewarm and would have benefited being a bit warmer but tasted good none the less.  the sauce had a punch of garlic but overall a good flavor.  finally the dessert was the best part with a trio of ice cream dusted with nuts.  i will definitely come back here!

Estragon Tapas,5,great during the summers as they open up their window.  very authentic atmosphere and food. very good tortas!
6B Lounge,5,i would have given them 5 stars but the set up of the store makes it difficult because of where you pick your food up at the end of the counter by the drink fountain. it causes confusion and a crowd around the drink fountain
Rigoletto,4,the loster roll was off the charts! oysters were fresh but a bit too salty. could provide more comfortable seating though.

M&J Teriyaki,5,"burger king had really gone down hill. while theyve upped their decor and presentation to try to match mcdonalds, their food has gotten worse. my girlfriend and i were standing at the register waiting to be helped. at least 6 employees passed by us doing other things, and when our cashier did finally make her way over to the register, she didnt even listen to what we said and had the worst attitude. i ordered i double whopper with avocado, bacon, no onions, and no tomato. i got a single whopper with a pickle sized dollop of what was definitely an imitation guacamole, terrible cheese, and what was just an overall terrible burger and undercooked fries. i guess thats what you get when two hamburgers, an order of fries and onion rings take 2 minutes to be made. just go to mcdonalds or hardees."
La Sultana Bakery,4,"crazy fresh oysters and delicious lobster roll with fried oysters!! by far the best ive had in boston. go there early though, as the line starts to form quickly shortly after they open on weekends."

Suculento Restaurante,5,"this was the most disgusting food ive ever aremind you,  i was 9 months pregnant and would eat just about anything. after waiting 2 hours the food came. i ordered a cheeseburger dinner, just fries and a medium rare cheeseburger. what i got was so disgusting i had to put it on facebook, after 3 minutes up it got 143 comments on how it looked so gross people wanted to vomit. first off, it was a frozen burger that you could buy at the cheapest grocery store around. it was so hard and burned when. i picked it up to shake it, it broke in too. the even more disgusting thing was the cheese on it. im not even sure it was cheese, it was see through, and a quarter size of the burger. the fries were cold mush. being pregnant and waiting so long for food i obviously cried. my husband called the place since we tipped 7 dollars we figured they would be kind enough to replace our meal.  i would no ever order another cheeseburger from there so my husband asked for chicken fingers instead. the guy huffed and puffed and moaned and complained how it would be coming out of his pocket ,. the delivery took another meal. most businesses would return your money and comp the meal. not this place, not only did they keep our money for there bubba burgers and government cheese, but they whined and bitched about bringing us a replacement. when the driver came back, my husband brought out the rancid hockey puck they called a burger  even the driver was disgusted. i wouldnt eat this food again if the planet blew up and they were the only restaurant  that remained "
Michaels Pasta in the Pan,5,good bar for be happy.
Boston Chowda Company,5,another dissapointment looking for a good burger in boston. the burger wasnt thick and it had a heavy oily taste.
Bon Me,4,best place to eat in the north end the fish is so fresh best calamari around seriously
Paani,4,"the food is ok. they have a pretty wide variety to choose from. the best thing about them is theyre open late, past 2am. if you are needing to grab a bite to eat after the club or just on a late night, this is the goto place. ive known people to drive from brockton clubs to the hen house just because nothing else is open. you cant beat chicken  waffles drunk "

Sullivan's Castle Island,4,always enjoy my visits to the chateau. food is delicious and food servers very friendly and professional.
The Hen House Wings 'n Waffles,4,"almost affluent service, definitely affluent prices. disappointingly, we were very selectively asked to pull our masks up when no one out of 20 people even had a mask to begin with. waiters have the masks pulled off their nose. the bartender making drinks without one. its not about masks, but dont jump on two people if you dont have a uniform standard. then he came to our table to make a comment about our child not sitting still?! it seems to be just one power hungry guy, but because of him we cant recommend it..otherwise an amazing view and decent food i would say great if the price point was a bit lower. water taxi 20 steps out."
No Relation,4,the best nachos around! friendly people. warm and inviting and right up the road from boston airport!
Emmets,4,"when we returned to boston from our visit on the west coast, after several travel delays it was nice to sit down, have a glass of wine and a tasty fish taco. the most impressive thing about this restaurant is that it has a parking lot. no parking fines for us this time."
The Maiden,5,"translated by google it used to be good, but after the new menu, it wont work. was good, not anymore with the new menu which took over in late 2019.it used to be very good, but his restaurant changed its menu at the end of 2019. not to mention the price, many of the previous signature dishes are now gone. the dishes on the new menu dont feel very distinctive.dont order the local chicken! giant pit! ! he had more bones than meat, so he dared to ask for 33 dollars. i think its so expensive and the portion is delicious, but the portion is average but there are many bones, and its still broken, which is troublesome to eat. although the chicken is boned, it does not have any freerange chicken meat... go back to the boneless chicken and add some chicken skin. the sauce chicken on the previous menu was actually very good, and it was only 17...the waiters are often in a hurry, asking for less spicy dishes twice in a row, and the receipts that are printed out also say less spicy, but the dishes we ate are still as spicy as always. but the service ecology is very good, worthy of recognition! food here could be extremely spicy  to a point that its barely edible if you didnt grow up having spicy food. i told them to make it mild twice with my orders, and both times they forgot to. that being said, their waiters are polite and sincere  much better than those chinatown waiting staff.sometimes his family receives too many takeaway orders and the food is very slow in the store. sometimes they take too many takeout orders to serve their dinein guests promptly.originalwas good, not anymore with the new menu which took over in late 2019.20193317food here could be extremely spicy  to a point that its barely edible if you didnt grow up having spicy food. i told them to make it mild twice with my orders, and both times they forgot to. that being said, their waiters are polite and sincere  much better than those chinatown waiting staff.sometimes they take too many takeout orders to serve their dinein guests promptly."

Antico Forno,5,"innovative, cajun style menu. gary louisiana buy beer. anyway you can choose between crabs fish mussels or clams, can i add different spices and sides. free example they have fried corn this is really good. the po boys are also delicious which are worth trying, specifically the catfish."
Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5,"fantastic drinks, good food, good service.we shared some oysters as well as carpaccio, a special of fish croquettes and a special sptzle with brussel sprout slaw. i dont enjoy oysters, but i disliked these less than usual. the carpaccio was bland to me, but my friend enjoyed it. i didnt think the fish got the flavor very much. the croquettes were very dry. the sptzle was amazing. i also had the crab cake, which i found odd because it was singular, and because it was bland. i have higher expectations for seafood coming here. i almost forgot that we shared the bourbon butter cake with a lemon sorbet which was delicious and perfect.i had a maple daiquiri and champagne with honey and cinnamon. both were fantastic and i would highly recommend.service was a bit confused to me. i wasnt sure who was going to take our order, or help us with anything because we kept seeing different people and one person took our drink order and one person took our food order."
L&C Spanish Restaurant,5,"3 refuge from the tourist traps! good home style food, very reasonably priced. theres often a line to get in and its worth it."
Myers+Chang,4,"heavy breathingcame here for brunch and holy fried chicken on waffles.alright ambiance, service, and food.ambiancethe space is great. big windows throughout. minimalist with an ode to micro brewery.serviceservice was difficult to gauge. the staff is very friendly, especially viviana, but they were also, what appeared to be, very busy and at times, not as attentive as i had hoped. regardless, the food was so good, it really did all of the heavy lifting for this review.foodour tables order was  greek yogurt, fruit  granola bowl, lobster benedict, sweet potato  chorizo hash, basicbreakfast, and the chicken  waffles. to drink, i also got a mimosa, coffee, and water. my table and i were a party of 3 and we decided to share it all. everything was mmm so good and tasty look that up on youtub. some of my favorite things is the fact the chicken for the chicken and waffles was a cutlet rather than full of bones. made it so much easier to eatenjoy. didnt take away at all from the flavor. the lobster benedict is amazing. i hate paying high prices for lobster not when it comes to this dish though. the sweet potato  chorizo works wonders together with the scrambled eggs. the flavors and texture really complemented each other.in conclusion, id come here again yesterday. it dangerous im walking distance from this place. i look forward to trying dinner dishes. four stars though because service had me playing with my emotions."
QDOBA Mexican Eats,5,"we arrived at this place for dinner. this place was recommended to us by a friend.  well, we were not disappointed. the crew were very polite and we had an excellent feeling. the meal was yummy. we had a great time and we will visit this place again. keep it up."

Mooncusser,1,"this was a very nice dinner, the lobster ravioli was awesome! the only downside is that they only accept cash so be prepared."
Pete's Dockside,5,they have awesome food... its cooked to perfection and delicious.
Cafe Polonia,5,"quick summary tacky decor, loud bad music and expensive mediocre food make this a dining experience to avoid.went here on a week night, not very crowded and was seated quickly in the main dining room where they have a live jazz band. the band really wasnt much to my liking, mostly cheesy covers that they tried to make jazzy. mediocre or bad music isnt usually a death knell though unless the music is deafeningly loud, which it was. at times you couldnt even hear people talking from across the table.second thing i noticed was the decor. whoever decorated this place seems to think that throwing up posters with french words will miraculously turn your establishment into an authentic french bistro. unfortunately the lack of detail and attention shows and makes it feel tacky all around.finally got around to ordering dinner, opted for the prix fixe option which isnt a bad deal at 44 for appetizer, dinner and dessert, but it should be noted that they limit your choices. started with a french onion soup and escargot. the soup was fairly mediocre, not very hot, and ive made better at home with little effort. the escargot were tasty, but its just garlic and butter and snails, so its fairly hard to mess this one up.had the fish and steak frites for dinner. the fish was completely tasteless, was tempted to send it back, but just ended up not eating much of it. the steak was underdone, still raw in the middle on a medium rare request, however, the sauce they made to accompany the steak was good.the dessert selection was extremely limited and most items were some variation of ice cream. we had the creme brle and a chocolate cremeux. the chocolate was passable, but nothing to get excited about. the creme brle was underwhelmingly mediocre and, although it was served cold, they clearly got a little too close with the propane as there were random warm spots of custard.to top it all off our waiter was abysmal, vanished for most of the service and this was when there were three tables in the entire restaurant. the busboy did a better job servicing our table and i was tempted to slip him 10 if only i had some cash on me.zygomates was a complete disappointment through and through. maybe they should do away with the loud live music and spend the extra cash on better food. at more than 50head this place isnt even close to being worth the money."
Moogy's,5,"order all the things, especially the salmon toast!"
Mangia Mangia Italian Kitchen,3,stepping into an eataly is like stepping into a marketplace in the heart of your favorite italian city. never fails to impress!
Doughboy Donuts & Deli,5,no bad buffet.
Tavern in the Square South Station,5,"not worth the money. overpriced, pretentious, incompetent cooking. service is ok and the place has some atmosphere, but certainly doesnt justify the price. wont return."
Cafe Polonia,5,we had the tofu and seasonal vegetables. very fulfilling. although my colleague then went back to the hotel and ordered pizzas. i guess she needs the carbs. otherwise very helpful. the service was quck. food was tasty with a chili zing to the salads. i go to dig inn for lunch during the work week and get either the chicken or meatball bowls. my favorite has to be their brown rice and sweet potatoes.
Wendy's,2,"a chic space that has two u shaped counters and an open kitchen. the strozzapreti with braised rabbit was savory and delicious. spicy tomato soup was flavorful, but seemed like more of a tomato sauce. scallops had impressive plating."
Uno Pizzeria & Grill,5,"impressive menu. creative update to traditional asian dishes. open and lively atmosphere.  the fish bao was crisp, fresh and a touch of spice. the bai itself was dry and tough to eat on one side.  the pineapple fried rice was good. the matcha ice cream with red bean donut was over cooked and tough.  there was only one server at the time. waited long time for water."
Panificio Bistro & Bakery,3,service is professional and friendly. food very pleasant to enjoy.
Mei Mei,5,best 2 for 5 whoppers cant beat that
Red Lantern Restaurant & Lounge,5,brilliant steaks

Donovan's Irish Pub,4,the food was great and the service was fast!
Dunkin',4,"visiting boston for four days, this was my favorite restaurant. menu options were inventive and delicious. severs were friendly and helpful. the atmosphere is casual and engaging music selection was excellent. i would recommend a visit to anyone, and i will return when im in the area again."
Five Horses Tavern - South End,5,"ive been a few times. its a nice enough place, but i just dont think the food is good enough for how much everything is. i always meet interesting people here and the waiters are very nice as well. but i go to restaurants for the food first, atmosphere second. and the food isnt calling me back here anytime soon."
South End Buttery,5,"after a few dud restaurants in a row, the food here is completely worth it. i am torn between a 4 or 5 star because space is so tight but the food and drink was so good. we had the crab rangoon 10 out of 10, chicken kebab 10, and beef dumplings 9. the popcorn shrimp 5 never came, so we just pretended we never asked and ordered another. we drank two drinks before they finally came and they were not worth the wait. the seating was extremely cramped on a friday night, so go in with that expectation. drinks were all as promised, tiki. our bill was a complete mess but the waitress handled it with zero issue. if i go again ill definitely be watching the bill like a hawk."
Phở Pasteur,5,its quite similar to chipotle. got mexican plate i didnt like that cuz everything is too dry i even couldnt eat. probably i went there wrong time.
Rinconcito Salvadoreño,5,"very touristy. food was just ok. service was good after they stopped arguing over who our table belonged to. it seems like the wait staff gets whatever table they lay claim to, which is weird. i expected better food, honestly. it wasnt bad, it just wasnt particularly good, either."

Falafel King,5,"short wait for table,staff is quick and friendly, breakfast is always good!"

Boston Fried Chicken,5,food is good...service is brutal....
Boston Market,5,it was worth the price. staff was exceptionally friendly
Max Brenner,5,"ive seen some really wonderful performances here, but the venue itself isnt the best. its either a hit or miss when it comes to getting a good view of the stage. ive been lucky whenever ive gone and had a good view from the balcony, but if i had arrived later and been stuck standing behind anyone i probably wouldnt have been able to see the stage."
Garlic 'n Lemons,5,pizza was ok... pricey for a not so fresh and somewhat cold by the slice pizza. floor and large family style table was messy
Siam Bistro,5,"the sign on the window reads, we make real food. i would certainly hope so! we had a bad case of circadian dysrhythmia jet lag, so we got there early in the morning, before anything else was open. i just wanted a cup of coffee to get me going, but i felt it necessary to order something else, as well. a piece of toast had to do, as my wife and our niece didnt want anything. they waited, and later we went down the street to walgreens, where you can get all kinds of goodies, and drinks, too!"
The Q,5,"its directly on the freedom trail, and just a bit short of halfway  a great stop if your touring of boston began early. the inside has a reasonable amount of seating for being such a prime location."

Lucky Cafe,2,"servers do their job well, the atmosphere is very hilarious and if you need to have a good laugh at yourself, then this is a resturant for you. if you are horribly uptight and cant laugh at an ironically rude waiterwaitress, then go to your vanilla restaurants. will for sure stop back through if im in boston."
Durgin-Park Restaurant,4,"very cool place with spectacular views of boston. food was disappointing though. i had a burrata with tomato, a ceasars salad, the salmon and the creme brulee. everything was average."
Lady M Cake Boutique,4,wow!  really good all around.
75 on Liberty Wharf,4,translated by google gourmetoriginal 
Legal C Bar,5,food was outstanding as usual. think this was our 2nd or 3rd trip here as we do really like the cooking at the monicas restaurants. had the pasta with lamb ragu and it was delicious the girlfriend had the potato gnocchi also very good. the service was also great i just find this location a little loud. trattoria di monica is still my favorite spot in the north end.
Sushiemon,4,i always stop purchasing some food in this spot. i love the swift customer service and well cooked dishes. fantastic work.
Wen's Yunnan noodle and Ramen 过桥米线,5,simple. delicious. huge portions. that is all
Lucky's Lounge,4,"been several times so far and did not disappoint. there are pitas, salads and plates. meat is tenderwell seasoned, sauces and dips are great, and service is fast. its a small place so be prepared for cramped conditions around lunch time."

Moon Bar,3,"very fast service. huge portion sizes. very reasonably priced. excellent taste and awesome salsa and family friendly. in all, highly recommend."
Paradise Biryani Pointe,1,"very nice place to eat italian recipes revisited in the american way. very friendly service. the pasta is worth spending a visit, and the prices are in the low range for boston standards. i suggest the meatballs as an appetizer. good wines as well on the list. recommended if you are in the mood of a wannabe italian cuisine."
The Bebop,4,"be cautious of this location, due to the fact that it is a hit or miss. half the time i have gotten drinks from shewsbury starbucks, it was made wrong or with no effort. that then resulted in a drink that tastes horrible, an example would be a mocha latte that tastes like nothing but warm milk. its supposed to taste like coffee with a nice mocha flavoring and be steamed to its standards. starbucks needs to look out for who they hire here, because the baristas are careless and quite often the rude ones work the shifts after 6 pm. i hope im not the only one who thinks this! hope this can help anyone, a better location is about 10 min down the road, in worcester on east central street. its right next to the 99 reaturant and has a nice drive thru with friendly service and accurate drinks !!!"

North End Fish & Sushi,4,"generally the second best hamburger chain, behind burger king."
Lambert's Marketplace,5,"third time visiting and im impressed by the consistency. each time we try something new and the food is fantastic. they serve the best homemade pizza in the local area, hands down. their appetizers are generous as are their main courses. the only con comes with their popularity  theyre often busy and have a bit of a wait. we waited over a half hour before being seated but it was worth it. dont let that fool you dont miss this great eatery."

Lilly's Gourmet Pasta Express,2,"as we watched the parade of lobster rolls and burgers with fried lobster as a crown it was hard not to order one of those. next time.instead, it was uni toast, fried oysters, clam toast and cioppino. all were wonderful. martini was very good. limited but nice wines by the glass.very attentive and cheerful service.i could have thrown a dart at the fascinating menu and been thrilled with wherever it hit. if you love small shop ambiance and seafood creativity, salty girl is a must visit. prepare to wait during busy times."

The Capital Grille,5,really good hot pots and also beer on the menu.
Cósmica,5,"there are no signs outside when i went to eat. i ended up walking past it a couple of times before realizing it. i made a reservation and i arrived just on time. i walked in its a small place with a handful of tables and told the waitress that i had a reservation. she told me that it would be 10 minutes and said to leave, walk around and then come back. at first i was taken aback, because of the way that she spoke to us. she was quite blunt and borderline rude. by the way, if you want to come during peak dinner times make sure you have a reservation because its a small place that fills up very quickly. at one point the waitress was turning people away who didnt have a reservation. after waiting it out we came back and were seated. we quickly realized that for such a tiny place, reservations were hard to keep on time so they did a reasonable job all things considered. after that we ordered our food. we got the stew with the mussels and that was delicious. it was a huge amount and im very happy that we split it in two. for the dinner we got the cherrystone clams linguini in white sauce and vegetable risotto. personally i preferred the linguini but i would happily take either one. the food was absolutely delicious. the dinner ended with the tiramisu which ive never had but my girlfriend has and she claimed that it was one of the best that shes ever tasted. overall it was a great experience and great food. now back to that waitress, she ended up being super nice and accommodating. she is blunt, and could come off as rude but her intentions are very good and i enjoyed having her as our waitress. i will definitely be coming back."
Douzo Sushi,5,ideal for a nice and secluded getaway. calming dark ambiance.trivia so dark you need a flashlight to read the menu.

Chuck E. Cheese,5,i like the spicy tender
5 Napkin Burger,5,good food cheap.
Dunkin,5,"never tried the food or experienced the place before. so myself and a friend order food to go because we wasnt sure what we doing for the night.  once i arrived i noticed that they had a bar and informed my friend of it, so we decided to stay because of it. while waiting for the drink i started to eat my food while doing so the bar manager asked me to stop because they want to keep it separate. so i wont be making that mistake again or cing back."
Anna's Taqueria,5,picked up a 12 platter of the sausage and broccoli cavatelli. it was slightly cheesy but not too garlicky. wouldve wanted larger pieces of broccoli though. the sausage was similar to broken up pieces of meatballs. nice sear. the meatballs were amazing 18 for 4. tender with a wonderful herby flavor. the tomato sauce punches through the salt.
JP Roti Shop,4,such a friendly atmosphere with authentic italian foods!!

Clover Food Lab,4,not too clean. questionable.
Darbar,5,"great food, but making a reservation does nothing to get a table. not sure what the point of taking a reservation is when there is still a 45min to an hour wait to sit down after a reservation time. its happened to me twice, ive learned my lesson. i wont be back."
6B Lounge,5,its just a overpriced stirfry buffet
Jimmy John's,5,great lobster roll 
Andy's Breakfast & Lunch,5,"great outdoor seating on the water for a wonderful end of summer evening. the menu is extensive and has something for everyone. unfortunately i didnt catch our servers name but she served our party of 9 with a smile and good sense of humor i was with the loudish birthday party of mostly guys.i ordered the blt wedge and added steak. calling it a blt wedge seems redundant bc a wedge usually has bacon, lettuce, and tomato anyway...but nonetheless it was delicious. my steak tips were cooked perfectly to order at medium rare and the wedge was a very good size. the blue cheese dressing was very flavorful some times blue cheese dressings can be too bland to bring out the flavors in the wedge but this was perfectly stinky cheesy.oh and the coffee was perfectly brewed illy brand, served in a substantial mug not a frufru cup that fits perfectly in both of your hands.i would definitely go back! thanks!"
Great Taste,4,"the ramen and its soup is still as good as back when they are located at allston, but the menu is much more focused on ramen only, no more takoyaki and no cold ramen this summer, at least not yet. perhaps when they fully settled down but for now the menu is not what it use to be. the ramen is still very good though."
Dunkin,5,"wonderful bar, strong drinks, excellent  vibe!"
Beehive Restaurant,3,my favorite bar near bu
North Street Grille,1,"this place has it all. its expensive, so be ready for that. but it has the atmosphere to impress. the staff that is so eager and attentive u will feel like his lord of the north. the food is excellent and plentiful. you will take home leftovers. from the match boxes in the glass bowl as you enter to the table you sit down at to the coat room girl as you leave, you will feel like the children of michael bloomberg.  and have eaten like a king."

University Grill & Pizza,5,"feels very authentic, was full of people, atmosphere was great. the food was really good,  based on soup broth which and raw  ingredients meet or vegetables you put inside until cooked. very simple, very tasty and also very cheap. the kind of place you werent expecting anything special but afterwards you are sure you are going to come back. i wish it was closer to where i live...service was also great. we sat at the bar and got a detailed explanation on how and what to eat before we understood the concept."

Nicoles,5,amazing food..the best italian food in boston..sometimes a long wait to get in but totally worth it
Beehive Restaurant,4,"the food was good but expensive for what we got. it was pretty cool eating at a really old place i appreciate the history. we also had a very attentive server. this was our first bowl of chowder and our first lobster roll of our visit. the chowder was great! very nice balance of flavors not too fishy. i liked the lobster roll too. the sweet flavor of the roll with the hot butter lobster was a good combination. the lobster seemed a little over cooked too me it was a little chewy, but still had a good flavor."
DiVito Brothers Italian Pizzeria,3,great neighborhood mexican place. authentic food. great service. 45 great

Galleria Umberto,4,dope oysters pretty good lobster a m a z i n g salmon crudo. good place if you like expensive seafood.
Pellino's Ristorante,5,"decent asian fusion food. not worth the lines out the door though. and the restaurant itself is just too packed with tables. very difficult to move around. if you must, just order take out and bring it home. youll be happier. or go somewhere else. i found it meh."
Friendly's,5,"lovely family atmosphere.  the owner saw i was new and came over to ask me how i liked my food.  good number of middle eastern diners eating lunch when i arrived which is always a good sign.  my mixed sharma plate was tasty and served with rice and vermicelli, pickles and tomatoes.  both meats were good but the chicken was better than the beef personal preference  lovely traditionally brewed turkish coffee topped off the lunch.  service was prompt and courteous."
Doughboy Donuts & Deli,5,"very patriotic, they have a nice flag flying over the restaurant but no illumination."
Stephi's in Southie,5,"most reviews are pretty accurate. not even close to authentic italian food. cafeteria food from high school or college was on the same level as spagnuolos. the tomato sauce tasted identical to a canned sauce. give prego and ragu its sauce back and make your own. our pasta dishes were linguine noodles soaked in a tomato soup like prego sauce, very unappetizing. extremely disappointing for a restaurant in the north end."
Hooters,5,place is packed with quick turnover. make it a stop on your next trip into china town.
L.A. Burdick Handmade Chocolates,4,"lunch special is 10 dollars. if you want ramen stay away, they literally just use instant ramen from a supermarket."

GRECO,1,good was quite good but for the price i expect better
Koy,4,"tasty, but strange plating and serving sizes."
Central Wharf Co.,3,"fantastic experience. a delicious assortment of fresh oysters, seafood and drinks. the ambiance is a little loud the space is small, but its a fun and lively spot for drinks and food.  if only the wait wasnt so long, id be there all the time."

Wingz & Tingz,5,"best dim sum in boston! we got a table for two with no wait at 1030am on a sunday! we usually go earlier in order to miss the crowds, but we got lucky. were regulars, but our visit last weekend was worthy of a review. a fine selection with the friendly service ive had there to date! buns, dumplings, rices, delicious fried things...it was all so good. a new feature since our last visit pour guards on the teapots. its so much safer. before, even an experienced tea drinkerdim sum goer could expect to spill a few cups on the table, but no more! we didnt spill a drop and it was super easy to refill our cups throughout the meal. as always, the atmosphere and decor are finenothing overly special, but not shabby. we also took quite a bit home with us for lunch and the rest of the family. we usually eat ourselves silly and spend about 60 for four people and we kept that rate this weekend."
FiRE+iCE,5,great promotions
Peach Farm,3,ordered..2 hours later  after multiple phone calls and just being told it would come soon. they tried to charge me double the price at 60 dollars for 2 noodle dishes and  orders of spring rolls. if you have their food is pretty good you need to go there as it is clearly a business with no business sense. they ended up ruining our night and we ordered pizza from dough which delivered in less than 30 minutes.

Kaju Korean Cuisine — Kenmore,4,general gaus chicken is very good

Tavern in the Square Shrewsbury,5,"i admire this place! they have high class meals, their menu is varied, the chief cook in that place is very trained, i like very much tasting all their dishes. the food is always of high class, the service towards the clients  is agreeable. i  go often to this place and i not even once was unhappy. i recommend it to all."

Oisa Ramen,5,great pho soup
Uni,3,best venue in town!

Tasty Burger,5,pretty great place
Rosa Mexicano,5,poor managnent.horrible place to eat...waiters suck
Felcaro Pizzeria,5,theres no sign outside indicating that youve found luckys. look for it on the corner of congress and a street close to the childrens museum. i really enjoy the vibe here. has a lounge with a neighborhood bar feel to it. it can get crazy at times. try the kobe sliders.
Troquet on South,1,great food.... the ambiance was just lacking
Thai Basil,5,"the staff had troubles keeping an inventory of what they have available. paid for two orders of prime rib, then they found out that just had enough for one. substituted with ribs because all chicken and turkey were sold out. ribs tasted just ok, but the prime rib was very overcooked with burnt edges. no jus provided either.  staff was courteous."

Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant,1,"bland food, lackluster service, ridiculous prices."
Scali Cafe,4,"foodmost of the dishes we ordered were great except the tuna tartare and tres leches cake.as soon as you ordered, they offered chips with three sauces and all of them were impressive. i highly recommend the pork carnitas nachos and shrimp tacos. both are satisfying and flavourful. the tuna tartare, on the other hand, was bland and the tuna itself was mediocre. they sprinkled salt unevenly on the chips to go with the tuna, which made it very salty on some parts. the pineapple ice cream on top of the tres leches was interesting the cake not so much.everything elsewe came during the pandemic, so we had to sit in their outdoor seating, which was on the side of the road. if a restaurant needs to turn a side walk into a seating area, i believe they should make an effort to make it even. i felt like i was going to slide off my chair. the restroom door was horrible as well. who designs restroom doors that are so hard to open?!"
Banners Kitchen & Tap,4,"burtons is good, this one is just like any other, and thats not a bad thing"

Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar,4,"um, whats not to love? great food, wine and service!"
Burtons Grill & Bar of Shrewsbury,5,all the food was either mostly gone or not fresh at all. i even bought a cookie that was so hard i nearly chipped my tooth and bit my tongue i had to bite down so hard. this place was great when it first opened up but its taken a hard fall. so disappointing.
Sunset Cantina,4,burgers are great and i like the thin patties. small burgers are a good size
Charleys Philly Steaks,4,beware.......35 minutes to get food from the take out window!!
McDonald's,5,short wait for food. fries were good.
Cornerstone Pizza Cafe,5,ordered a house salad from the to go page and i was dissatisfied. the order site did not offer any add ins such as protein options. they also were very stingy with the black olives. never again im better off going to a local pizza shop for a salad next time.
Santarpio's Pizza,5,"great little hole in the wall that sticks the the classics. went in and grabbed calimari, lobster ravioli, and a seafood fettuccini. all this paired with the complimentary sourdough made for an amazing meal. the food matched with the great service made for a great date night. will definitely be back, best italian in north end so far."

M.J. O'Connor's,5,"i usually come to stephanies for brunch when i have friends or family visiting. it is a very popular boston spot, with an airy interior, and great outdoor seating. they have loaded bloody marys and all the classic brunch options plus extras like monkey bread. for lunch i love the chicken salad, goat cheese salad, or tuna melt, and dinner is awesome too. it is a little on the pricier side, and id recommend making a reservation."

Tikkaway Grill,4,our go to sushi place outside of boston
The Hungry I,5,"we sat at the bar of meritage restaurant. not to be mistaken for the wine bar on the street level, meritage is on the second floor of the boston harbor hotel. the bartender , gramm was wise beyond his years. he provided excellent service , similiar to the service we received at at michelin five star restaurant in vienna, austria. we had three appetizers and a dessert. each one was a treasure. the atmosphere was nothing i have experienced in the city since moving there 16 months ago. a true hidden gem to me and maybe you too.we will return and sit at the bar or request a table overlooking the boston harbor."

Old Tyme Italian Cuisine,5,"i dont know about the food but the guy serving is so rude, i would never ever ever buy a single thing from this joint. the guy was just plain nasty!i took 3 tissues and he yelled at me for that. no wonder it has a 2.7 rating and nobody buys food from him."

Dunkin,3,"great service and the food is great if you like starbucks! it is a great place to sit and study at while having a drink, with chairs right next to big windows and a lounge area. parking can be hard so i would recommend parking near the park down the street and walking to the starbucks, or taking the bus there as it stops right out front."
Boston Kebab House,5,"enjoyed the patio during a particularly warm afternoon,"

Tasty Burger,5,seems a very popular spot in the neighborhood.  got very crowded after we had just arrived. but it is a very tiny restaurant see pic. but the meals were excellent.  had fajitas and quesadillas.  i knocked 1 star off for charging us 3 for two very small shot glass servings of salsa.  charging for salsa at a mexican restaurant to me is a sin.  but overall food was delicious and i would come back.  but think twice about ordering salsa... at a mexican restaurant.

Zuma,5,we visited this place at lunch time. we had a great experience with this establishment some time ago in ontario so decided to try it out. we were not that thrilled. the service was great but the food was just not that great. it lacked the taste and unfortunately did not meet our expectations. perhaps there will be a next time.
Taranta,5,"overall rating 810  good but not amazing. i liked it and its probably one of the best southern bbq restaurants in boston, ma but i wouldnt go back anytime soon due to the steep prices. really impressed with their biscuits, pork belly, and pork ribs. but didnt blow my mind.trays are very filling and food satisfied our bbq craving. also allegedly better than smoke house in boston  the ribsmeat at smoke house were way too dry.1biscuit  appetizer 4 each  comes with honey butter. their homemade strawberry jam is 3 extra and its nothing special. would not recommend getting the jam. but omg, their honey butter is amazing  whipped, light, and with a lingering hint of honey thats not overpowering but you can definitely taste it. i would buy a jar of that butter if they sold it. biscuit is large, warm, fresh, fluffy  tall vs. dense  squished, with several layers. its really good by itself but especially heavenly with the honey butter. i would come back just for the biscuit and honey butter. best i ever had and this is coming from someone who does not like southern biscuits at all. 1010.2ginger beer 3.50  thought it was a light alcohol beverage but its just a soda which was a huge disappointment. note that it has an absurd amount of sugar 49g as well. tastes just like ginger ale. as of july 2019, barritts bermuda stone is their new ginger beer provider. they rotate providers once in a while.for the big  fat trays, you can only choose between 7 meat options vs. the 11 meat options for the onemeat trays.3big cheeks tray  choice of 2 meats with a choice of 1 hot scoop  1 cold scoop 24  meats pork belly  pork ribs. sides potato salad cold and macncheese hot. the pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious. a good ratio of fat and meat and not too oily. would recommend. the pork ribs were surprisingly one of the best ive had at any bbq place. usually, the pork ribs at bbq places are dry and then smothered in sauce to cover the fact that its so dry. but here, the skin is perfectly crispy not burnt, black, and cracked and rubbed with the perfect amount of spices. the meat is really tender that once you bite into it, the meat falls off the bone. the potato salad was nothing special and wouldnt get it again. the macncheese was decent. the crumb topping was good once it was mixed in with the pasta. meat 910. sides 710.4fat cheeks tray  choice of 3 meats with a choice of 1 hot scoop  1 cold scoop 26  meats bbq chopped brisket, pork ribs, and pulled chicken. sides potato salad cold and macncheese hot. the sauce for the brisket was really good. had a nice kick to it and it wasnt too salty. it was a bit dry underneath all that sauce  was expecting more melt in your mouth. pulled chicken was okay  the bbq sauce was decent but the chicken was dry. wouldnt get it again. meat 810. sides 710."

Laz Cafe,5,"quaint little space, very reasonable prices, and attentive service. the vegetarian pho and stir fry dishes we ordered were delicious and came out fast. one important thing to note is that if we hadnt inquired about it, even the vegetarian dishes we ordered would have been prepared with oyster sauce as almost everything on their menu contains. appreciated that our server offered to ensure what we ordered would be made truly vegetarian. we certainly will be back!"
Boston Pizza Company,3,"nice chinese buffet, also includes sushi bar."
Sweet Cheeks Q,2,i did a catering order for my kids birthday and it was delicious! we got the new england clam bake package it was a ton of food. the lobsters were cooked perfectly and my guests were very impressed. looking forward to doing it again next year.the staff was great and very helpful and friendly. the whole process was easy and much better than other restaurants ive used before for catering.
McDonald's,4,i went to chipotle like i usually do on my break since i work right at walgreens and this time they literally took 30 minutes to get me a chicken quesadilla and my chips and guac. honestly it does not take 30 minutes which was my whole break to get me that mind you there was only four to five people in front of me and i get there wasnt a lot of people working there but it seemed like they were too concerned with their own things to deal with customers. they were never like this and ive been experiencing this for the past couple months and today is the last day i ever go to that chipotle!
Amateras Ramen,3,the chicken sandwich was great! the chicken had a crispy crust and was tender and juicy. the shedded brussels sprouts and bacon was the perfect side dish. the cornbread appetizer was sweet and delicious  almost like a desserr. cannot wait to go back!

Maxine's On Saint James,5,fantastic meal with a super cool vibe. we came here on a monday night during covid and there were not many people in the restaurant and they have plastic shields up between tables so we felt very safe. we loved all of the food we ordered especially the lobster crab mac and cheese and our cocktails were delicious. its also a crime if you dont try the beignets. this is a wonderful south end restaurant and we are really hoping they make it through the pandemic.

SURA BBQ Boston,5,beautiful and nice ambient. long lines on weekends
Flatbread Company Brighton,5,"it is not bad, but this place confuses me. outwardly it looks fancier than what it is. inside, it has the comfort of your neighborhood familiar bar or dive. looks nice though. nothing to write home about. but if you want to catch a conversation with a friend or collaborator, then have the standard beer and  stuff. i once tried a mixed drink, wasnt very impressed. but gotta admit, been a year from that. however they are laid back and treat you well."
"Explorateur Cafe, Restaurant & Bar",4,"food was good, but the wait and the service were okay at best. not as good as other locations."
The Oyster Club,5,"authentic greek fast food  delicious and a great price! they do things right  great tzatziki, fresh tomatoes, real feta cheese, warm pita bread, and the works. i love their zucchini fritter bowl with a pita on the side. the only complaint i have one sauce is not enough! its hard to appreciate the flavors of this place the sauces are were it really comes out without trying more than one to give some flavor to your meal. go ahead and ask for more than one  you wont regret it! saloniki  please consider giving 2 sauce options or making them larger portions."

Moe's Southwest Grill,5,"visited today after a long time.  this place has gone way down in quality, a disgrace actually.  spinach tasted like paste or some chemical, not like spinach.  quantity was small, chicken was extra greasy and small.  water, 16 oz, 2.29!  they dont  care anymore and it is evident.  girl was rude too and walked away without giving me my receipt,  had to lean way  over counter to the other side to retrieve it.  place needs to close.  i wont go back.  maybe if they fire the manager, which they should do swiftly.  also owner should sell to a more competent owner and promise to never go into the restaurant  business again."

Area Four Boston,5,very good and very tasty
Dunkin',5,"this is definitely the hidden gem of south boston. because of its location it can get lost among the other restaurants nearby but once you find it you wont regret it. once inside this place feels so warm and inviting with dimmer lighting and candles spread across the whole place. there is a bar area with some high top tables next to it and a small quaint dining area in the back with only four tables. the bartenders and wait staff are equally inviting and hospitable as well as very verse with the menu to help you match what youre looking for with whats on the menu.the draft beer menu is great and always changing in addition to the great list of bottles. they also have an extensive wine list. as far as good is concerned, you wont leave unhappy. they have charcuterie and curry dishes and many things on the menu that you wont be able to find anywhere else. i loved the asianinspired ribs, the mussels, and especially the hush puppies with their maple butter sauce.if you live in or near southie or are just in the area this place is a must visit. you wont be disappointed."

Erbaluce,5,"heavy breathingcame here for brunch and holy fried chicken on waffles.alright ambiance, service, and food.ambiancethe space is great. big windows throughout. minimalist with an ode to micro brewery.serviceservice was difficult to gauge. the staff is very friendly, especially viviana, but they were also, what appeared to be, very busy and at times, not as attentive as i had hoped. regardless, the food was so good, it really did all of the heavy lifting for this review.foodour tables order was  greek yogurt, fruit  granola bowl, lobster benedict, sweet potato  chorizo hash, basicbreakfast, and the chicken  waffles. to drink, i also got a mimosa, coffee, and water. my table and i were a party of 3 and we decided to share it all. everything was mmm so good and tasty look that up on youtub. some of my favorite things is the fact the chicken for the chicken and waffles was a cutlet rather than full of bones. made it so much easier to eatenjoy. didnt take away at all from the flavor. the lobster benedict is amazing. i hate paying high prices for lobster not when it comes to this dish though. the sweet potato  chorizo works wonders together with the scrambled eggs. the flavors and texture really complemented each other.in conclusion, id come here again yesterday. it dangerous im walking distance from this place. i look forward to trying dinner dishes. four stars though because service had me playing with my emotions."

Doña Habana Restaurant,5,they have one of the rudest cashiers i have ever met. she has like zero customer service skills. you talk to her and shes whispering profanity and giving you attitude like you are nobody. will never go there again and will definitely be telling this irritating story to everybody.
Hong Kong Harbor,5,"i ordered take out. waited a long time for my order. i live 10 minutes away and by the time i got home on a 90 degree summer day, my food was ice cold.it must have sat waiting for pickup for a long time.  the food was tasty. but it shouldnt have been that cold."
Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse,5,"as expected, and thats a good thing. we stepped out onto kneeland street at 1145 on a rainy cold day, with time for just a quick lunch. i suggested pho, but my lunch partner is not a big fan, so we settled on panera, which was maybe 2 blocks away. we were 2nd in line and a few minutes later done ordering. my 3 bean chili was good if not memorable, she was pleased with her soup and salad. we got our food in about 10 minutes. the place was warm and reasonably clean. the wifi was good, so we stayed a bit after we had finished. we easily made our 1 pm appointment. now all this might not sound terribly exciting, but it more than met our needs. you can depend on panera in these situations, but you probably already know this "

Granary Tavern,4,"i had a great brunch here with family. its a very busy place and we had to call early in the morning to be put on a waitlist to get in by 10 a.m. we overheard someone being told that the wait time for a table was 2 hours, so definitely call in advance for the waitlist when theyre busy! theres both indoor and outdoor seating, and the decor is very lively and fun.there can be a long wait for your food after ordering because of how busy it is, but its well worth the wait because the dishes are well prepared and delicious! i recommend eating here if you can."

Cappy's Pizza & Subs,5,meh. not worth the wait at all. the food is good but not worth the 40 min wait outside.

Five Guys,5,"one of the best, if not the best, steak house in boston. both service and food, 1010. highly recommended."
Myers+Chang,2,always a solid choice for a nice little business lunch
Ba Lẹ Restaurant,5,"long wait, service was not so complimentary"
Au Bon Pain,1,"i can taste the similarity between the original reginas in the north end, they clearly use the same recipe and probably ingredients.  but it lacks a certain je ne sais quoi, perhaps its the 100 year old oven in the north end that makes the difference, or perhaps the lack of a line down the block takes away from the experience. or maybe it is just a bit too franchisey to maintain a high degree of excellence. overall, its a solid pizza joint and mediocre bar, but its pretty good for the most part."
Tiger Mama,4,i find it ncredible how quickly they serve the amount of people they do and do it so well. their food is very good and they dont price gouge.  sullivans may be one of the very best snack bars in country!!!
Equator Thai Restaurant,5,one of the few left in business
Sportello,5,"my partner and i felt unsafe in terms of covid provisions, so much so that i couldnt enjoy my meal."

Irashai Sushi,5,great small plate seafood.
The Improper Bostonian - Live Music Venue & Bar,5,"if you can deal with being ingnored for 10 to 30 minutes until they take your name, then wait awhile up to two hours on a weekend for them to call you, then wait again to be seated... only at that point will you have earned the honor of unlocking an excellent seafood experience in the north end. its a shame that your first experience will always be with the abrasive hostess because she is in stark contrast to the warm, chatty, and informative servers once youre in. being a huge oyster person, id rate the oyster selection as one of the top two in boston but what i really go for is the cioppino. there isnt a bad thing on the menu though. the lobster roll is 2 in the city out of town folks are always looking for the perfect one. the wine selection is also great and the bar staff is helpful in making recommendations. try for off peak hours but its worth the wait too... just pop into one of the many great restaurants nearby for drinks and apps until you get that call that your table is readyish."
Ristorante Villa Francesca,4,"greasy and good, but for a place that essentially serves 2 foods, they could be better at both.  what redeems them is their bacon milkshakes.  ive tried to get other places to put bacon in my shakes to no avail.  why is it so hard to find battered fries?!?"
T Anthony's Pizzeria,4,4 for 4 is life
Haru Sushi,3,"it took an hour and half for tacos to be delivered to my 11 year old and his mother that live less than a mile away. food was cold and you made the wrong tacos. you disappointed my son. remember your customer are paying for quality food and amazing services. you need to learn the business and who is important, thats the customers"

Table Boston,4,"i had a delicious chicken gyro at gyro city. everything was hot and tasted fresh. quite possibly the best gyro ive ever had, and ive probably had 50 different gyros.  i like that you get fries on your sandwich. the mustard sauce that comes with the chicken gyro is excellent. the place was pretty crowded, but my sandwich was ready in about 3 minutes.unlike similar assemblyline style burrito places, dont stand around waiting for the gyro artist to take your order. instead, order and pay at the register first. theyll give you a number and call you when your order is ready."
Stoddard's Fine Food & Ale,3,great food. especially the daily specials. comfortable atmosphere.
Red Crab Juicy Seafood,5,the spicy red sauce is amazing.... definitely leaves a nice burn in your mouth... will get it every time

Hong Kong Eatery,2,"no reservations, no way to save a place with the host.  im sure the food is  good, but i hate places that artificially create a line."
Wahlburgers,5,"delicious italian food! although it can be pricey, its generally worth it. only reason i dont give it 5 stars is because a few of the plates dont live up to their price, but to be fair most of the pasta ive ordered has been delicious."
The Halal Guys,5,"we got there just before the lunch rush, we were seated promptly and comfortably. the lunchbrunch menu was very long. the choices of food ranged from that of a vegetarian to that of a wholehearted carnivore. all foods were served promptly and hot.the prices were , but you are in the theater district and the prices or appropriate for the area. service was excellent and very polite. i would go again especially when attending the theater."

Sami's,5,darryls did a great job tonight for my son jermaines dads memorial . thank you for a beautiful evening  rip kevin
Bodega Canal,5,"first, its not a must go and have place if you care for taste. if you love the ambience, then i would say a good choice and will give a four star for that. and the names of the items are so cunning and make you confused. food is average except the dosa section. all the combinations are sounds so great but my experience is not that great. yes , its my personal opinion and my wife too have the similar. i went to vaanga after hearing a lot from my friends and i was disappointed!. everyone was having biryani on that day, but we chose the dosa and shakkeela. dosa was okay but not the sambaar. and the food is already prepared and kept as shown in the picture most of them so you never know!. i think biryani should be okay as mostly eating the same and i didnt tried it. will update if at all i am going there second time my wife says will not go there again, but you never know!"

Greenhills Irish Bakery,4,i love the hell out of flames but beware of this location.  the staff is slow as hell.  im trying to figure out on a sunday morning why are we standing in line more than 15 minutes and there are only three of us in the line.  the best location is the one on morton street in mattapan.  its being rebuilt due to a .  i cant wait untill they open back up.

Gaga Seafood Restaurant,5,"i ordered a veggie burger, and i asked the cashier to put the guacamole that comes on the burger on the side. she says okay and tells me its going to be 12, but before i asked for the guacamole on the side it was 10. so, im guessing that she is charging me for extra guacamole at this point, and i ask her how is that possible? im not asking for extra, i just want something that comes on my burger on the side... i ask her to get someone else to help because she clearly didnt know what she was doing and she was getting annoyed. so another girl comes to help out and she resolves the issue. while i was waiting for my order, there was a dog on a leash tied to a pole like a few feet away from me. im unsure whose dog it was, but the next thing i see is the girl who just resolved the issue out there playing with the dog. i could not believe it! she was scratching his fur, hugging, and rubbing her coat up against him. to make matters worse, i dont know if she even washed her hands, but i see her right back in the kitchen area. im pretty certain that is a huge health hazard... so, i get my order and everything is okay with my food. i take about 4 sips of my child sized drink because idk why tasty burger doesnt give average sized drinks and then im like oh hell no, my drink was done. i opened the cup and the ice was filled literally to the brim. at least in europe, where they serve you the same size cup with your meal, they dont put any ice in the drink because they know you cant get a free refill and they want you to enjoy as much of your infantsized drink as possible. not tasty burger..."

Burtons Grill & Bar of Shrewsbury,5,"local microbrewery with typical pub food with a few highlights. foodwise, my favorites are the salmon burger, even though its a little messy, and the fried haddock sandwich, with sweet potato fries. there are a few beer staples the hub light, the blueberry, the back bay ipa, the boston red and the nut brown ale, to name a few, but a lot of the beers are seasonal and they cycle in and out throughout the year. an annual favorite is the watermelon ale, available between memorial day and labor day. check the board to see what the theme of the month is. there are definitely a few experiments i wish i could forget the rosemary beer being one notable example but the brewers here are always experimenting and have produced some really interesting beers that dont exist anywhere else. that alone makes it worth stopping in."

Canton House,5,"place looks and sounds like a regular local pizzeria,  however,  owned and managed by venezuelans,  having original venezuelan dishes like tequeos, empanadas,  cachapas, chicha, sancocho in between others."
Carrie Nation Cocktail Club,5,i have never had a worse restaurant experience in my life. we went with around 8 people. they brought out a bunch of raw meat plates to cook and the grill wasnt even warm enough to cook steak so i wasnt going to even attempt to cook the chicken. little did i know that when you order all you can eat they charge you extra  for what you didnt eat. i didnt eat almost any of it on the first and only round of food. i love scallion pancakes and lve never had bad ones until last night. super greasy and undercooked. they charge for adult portions if youre over 8 and we had two girls who were 9 and didnt end up eating any of the food other than a few bites of white rice. our bill was 700 . the server was terrible and the food wasnt even good. you could go anywhere and spend this kind of money.

Towne Stove and Spirits,1,"we had about an 8 course prix fixe meal here, and every course was absolutely delicious. service was great. we were here as a large group, but i can see this being a great date night spot."
Sichuan Gourmet Billerica,5,"normally pretty good but dont order the steak and cheese. if you get it plain, its 99 steak, 1 cheese, and if they ask if you want everything on it, they dont mean what you think by everything. you probably think they mean grilled onion, pepper, and mushroom, but they mean raw onion, tomato, pickle, and mayo. to be fair, the former toppings are usually in a steak bomb, which they do have, but christ, i wouldnt have expected them to put half of another mediocre sandwich in there. maybe im crazy and thats normal. had to throw it out though, i couldnt even eat it or remove the toppings. actually writing this review while i figure out what to eat instead. pizza is good though, so it evens out."

Tienda Y Taqueria San Antonio,3,"once i asked for a well done  not pink burger. i started eating and it tasted wrong, the lighting was so dim that i couldnt see what i was eating. i took over half of it to go. next night i unboxed it to realize it was fully pink which explained why i was sick that morning.i should also add that atmosphere is very nice and dim lights are romantic as long as you dont need to see what you will be eating... but as for the food taste in general, i am not a fan. i went and had their famous mac and cheese recently and its definitely heavy but nothing special. the foods are typical american fast and fatty foods where one meal equals 1,000 calories plus."
Donna's Restaurant,5,"when marliave lost the reservation for 14 people on a saturday night, they offered nothing. we walkrd across the road to see if mast could help, and they were phenomenal! mast opened up a private room downstairs, and we were able to celebrate my birthday by mingling for an hour with cocktails, then during to a fabulous sicilian feast we are not talking red sauce, but authentic island cuisine. amazing service thank you donabella!, excellent cocktails and wine list. we will be back!"
Max Brenner,5,"even though the burgers are already cooked and placed in a warmer, it was really delicious. i added the egg and that made the burger taste better. the bread is light. vegetables are fresh. the burger patty should be a little thicker and a little bit more cooked. the fries are crispy. overall a good burger."

No Name Restaurant,3,great service   1 food excellent  get here try for yourself .....
Pho Viet’s,5,"great oysters, cocktails  service. this place also has a pretty cool and chill atmosphere. the only downside to this place is the fact that for 1016 you can get two overwhelmingly bland and completely forgettable tacos. if you order something other than tacos i think anyone can easily find this place quite enjoyable."

The Oceanaire Seafood Room,3,"chinese buffet with habachi, good food"
Sunny Cafe,4,they are very welcoming and will help you with anything you need.
Franco's Trattoria,4,always a favorite local restaurant. be prepared to wait in line as they are always busy. and if you do in the cold months please keep the doors closed. the exhaust fan in the kitchen draws so much air that when both doors are open it creates a draft that is unpleasant when your eating. the thai servers are to nice to mention that to the customers waiting so i will. the food is great i wish the chicken salad came back
Ruth's Chris Steak House,5,"understaffed. pizza selection strange and the pizza crust is unique. not bad, but not typical pizza."
Deuxave,4,"rinos amazing. best italian in east boston, if not in greater boston. weve dined here several times and have yet to be disappointed. try the lobster ravioli or the veal sorrentino, both are excellent. small seating capacity, so call ahead or be prepared to wait. parking in the area is a challenge, be patient. give it a go, youll be glad you did!"

Artisan Bistro,5,one of my favorite sushi places in the back bay. fresh sushi and tons of options!  i particularly like their bento boxes.  chicken catsu! yummy!
Double Chin Modern Asian Restaurant,4,"recently made my second visit here after having a decent, albeit crowded, experience during restaurant week. was expecting the same quality of food only to be disappointed.my first tipoff should have been that it was a major holiday weekend and no one was in the restaurant, not even wait staff. apparently this also applied to the kitchen staff who could only serve one decent dish.french onion soup was candy sweet, completely disgusting. my steak tartare was mostly a giant brown old lump, thankful that i didnt get food poisoning. the bone marrow was barely present, basically yielding a single bite. the steak frites had soggy fries and a steak that was almost uncuttable. the chicken dish was so overwhelmingly dry that it had to be sent back. and finally, the one success of the night was the duck breast which was good.service was fine, but the chef was either asleep or out of town. for the money its not even close to being worth the risk. one bad experience is all i need to never return. if you cant serve quality food every night then close your doors on the off nights."
Cafe Podima,5,service was good and food was excellent
Exodus Bagels,4,"the food is nothing special but the atmosphere is nice, wine selection alright with reasonable prices."
Laz Cafe,5,nice and spacious
Saloniki Greek,5,"best brunch in boston. just dont tell anyone else about this place. its busy enough as it is. free parking next to sowa which is dope. make a day of it. good drinks, better food, and atmosphere to match. keep an eye for holiday special menus or events. make a reservation. save yourself the heartache. prix fixe is fire. and order the pastry basket for the table. jetaime gaslight"

Legal Test Kitchen,5,best country fried chicken !!
Fresh City,5,"best haitian patties around but the wait is terrible but worth it. they need two cash registers because they are always busy. and they need, need, to start being able to take orders over the phone. people shouldnt have to drive possibly 45 mins to the bakery to wait in line for another 2030 mins just to place an order for a party. every restaurant takes party orders over the phone and payment for said orders. get with the times! but keep up the good work."
Tutti Frutti,5,"great steaks, tips, and salmon. service was great!i would love to go back! recommended."
Mangia Mangia Italian Kitchen,5,is a very diverse very airy nice mellow environment the food is absolutely delicious

Greenhills Irish Bakery,4,"ive eaten here twice and both times the food was amazing! the second time i got to try so many things and all of the appetizers, my entree and dessert were phenomenal. i highly recommend getting the seafood platter and trying the crab meat, oysters, shrimp. i had the black seared salmon and it was life changing. their sides are so good. and my carrot cake dessert was to die for!"
Giacomo's Boston North End,4,"cute place for date night. a little pricey for what is served. chocolates fondue, chocolate drinks."
Pauli's,5,tried the impossible burger. it was good but the portion was less
Pete's Dockside,5,very busy place but everything was slow from the beginning. i ordered a simple margarita from the bar. the drink was way too sour for my taste. after looking at their menu there isnt any appetizing courses. everything was just too bland and discouraging. i apologize to the kind and sweet waiter that tried so hard to accommodate me. legal c bar had nothing to satisfy my hunger it was more like i was at a waiting room than a restaurant.
Back Bay Social,4,super fast online service and great meatballs!
Cappy's Pizza & Subs,5,food always great. today clam chowder and fish and chips the best!

Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,very affordable with great food and drinks
Kaju Korean Cuisine — Kenmore,1,good indian food counter.
Aquitaine,5,outstanding sushi and service in a modern and comfortable atmosphere. every sushi roll was fresh and flavorful with some unique and delicious combinations and excellent ingredients. my personal favorite was the artist roll but the monthly special yin and yang was also excellent. service was friendly and helpful  though you may wait a bit for the sushi it is masterfully prepared with care and skill and well worth the wait. pricing is fair for the quality and on par for the area. we were told the entrees are fusion style and will be back to try them in the future. i cannot recommend nobo enough for any lovers of sushi nearby.
Longwood Grille & Bar,3,tandoori wings are the best!
Stephi's in Southie,5,outstanding italian food but an unimpressive wine list.

Food For The Soul,3,translated by google very expensiveoriginalmuy caro
Italian Express Pizzeria,4,good service.could be better burger was a bit salty and oily. dry aged rib eye was not as soft and tasty as expected. medium ordered dry aged new york was a bit medium rare. kitchen could be faster.comparison capital grille at boylston and grill 23 are better.
Tuscan Kitchen,1,translated by google a restaurant that exceeds expectations .. respectable staff .. and delicious food original   ..    ..   
Abby Lane,5,"i dine here every year for my birthday. the service and food are always excellent. the only reason i didnt give it five stars is due to the fact that in past years, while dining for a birthday, you would receive a gift card for 25.00 in addition to some chocolate truffles. this year, however march 26, 2018, that was not the case. otherwise, everything was great as always."
Club Café,5,the meal was great. a group of 4 with tapas style plates. my favorite plate of the entire meal....the pimento cheese toast...good lord.the mixed drinks tasty refreshing.  they did take  a little to come out but were worth the wait in the end. i will be back to try the bigger plates and have more of that pimento cheese toast.
Clay Pot Cafe,5,good omelets
Tremont 647,5,always authentic italian 
Dunkin',4,the margaritas are a high point and the food is pretty good but the wait was nuts. we waited for over 2 hours for a table and they would not give us a solid wait time until we were already there for an hour. i know that they didnt want to lose business but they should be more truthful to their clientele.
Warehouse Bar & Grille,5,i love the chicago style deep dish pizza!
Au Bon Pain,5,"awesome spot, great vibes"
Mo'Rockin Fusion,4,the dj was fantastic
Strega Italiano Seaport,5,good people and friendly atmosphere
Kantin,4,"this dominos is terrible. they almost always mess up my order wrong sauce, wrong side, wrong pizza or just plain forget an item. delivery takes twice as long as you expect. last time they forgot an item, it took 15 minutes for someone to pick up the phone, and then they argued about making and delivering it, then just didnt. i was so mad not to get my cinnastix. do not have high expectations, or expectations at all when ordering from this dominos. just dont."
Clover Food Lab,5,delicious!  chinwich with spam fries!
M.J. O'Connor's,5,"good food, but if you are going to have  a big open sign, how about a small sign saying preorders only. i walked several blocks hoping to get a good sweetgreen salad only to be told i would have to download an app and then wait outside until it was complete. and yes, i saw the sign, thats my picture on google maps."
Beijing Cafe,5,really enjoyed this place
Joe’s Waterfront,4,great pulled pork!

99 Restaurants,1,tried the reuben.  overpriced and small.  wouldnt get it again.
Deb's Diner,5,"jason was great, my chicken milanese was to die for "
Hulun Beir,5,"food was awful and so was the service. waitress was rude and inattentive. their practices were also unsanitary. the brisket seemed like it was straight out of a oscar meyer package and drowned in bad bbq sauce. the sausage and potato quesadilla barely had any sausage and the cheese wasnt melted. very bland. the fajita meat was very dry and under seasoned. i watched the bartender place drink tickets directly on top of the drinks so it was drowning in the liquid. their salsa bowl was uncovered and near a very busy area. one waitress poured salsa in a bowl, must have seen something wrong with the bowl, poured the salsa back in and then rescooped it into a different bowl. i watched one person pick up spilled chips off of the counter with their hands and throw them back in the bin of chips where they fill baskets from where they at least use a metal scoop. a couple of us woke up sick the next day. i would love to say that maybe this was an off day but it seems to be a case of management not caring."
High Spot Deli,5,very cheap and delicious dim sum
Theo's Cozy Corner Restaurant,5,"food was good, if expensive."
Area Four Boston,2,slightly on the pricey side but the food was delicious and authentic. tried basically 50 of their menu now and everything has been great so far.

7 Chinese Restaurant,4,i like the red lantern
Locale,5,"food is good. enjoyed the meal.drinks lean strong good if youre trying to rage, not so good if you like finesse and balance and are diverse. a bit expensive.if you like dark ambiance with black satin and low red light, it will suit you just fine, especially if you hail from transylvania.all kidding aside, its got a lot to offer and is worth a visit."
Royals,3,really great food and cocktails! knowledge and friendly wait staff!
Pollos A La Brasa Beto's,3,"cool historical pub in boston that was founded by the town crier, jimmy wilson, in 1795. they have a special sam adams beer as he was a frequent patron. great seafood! a little pricey though as most of these spots are. it was pretty easy to get in with 2 people for dinner, but i hear it fills up later at night! four stars because its pretty touristy."
Sullivan's Castle Island,5,good food
Oisa Ramen,5,best chocolatier in boston. hands down.
Penang Malaysian Cuisine,5,clean bar..
Four Seasons Buffet,5,great and authentic greek food. their ambiance is really interesting and makes a wonderful dining experience. keep in mind that it is small plates and meant to be shared.
Wendy's,2,fun atmosphere. good beer. very tasty burger!
The Blackstone Grill,4,come here often with a large group. always treated courteously despite the fact that we make it difficult by separating the checks. servers are knowledgeable about different beers and can help negotiate their extensive beer list. food is always good as well.
The Glenville Stops,5,small but okay. service is okay
Paradise Biryani Pointe,5,"the food was good. the chicken cheese steak waffle with cocoa dusted waffle fries was good but nothing too special. the waffle itself was thin and could have been a little thicker or crispier to give the sandwich more structure and make it easier to pick up. the waffle fries dusted with cocoa were a fun novelty, but tasted pretty normal. the make your own sundae included good chocolate drops and milk chocolate, as well as whipped cream, a waffle cone, and sprinkles, but it was a little too sweet for my taste and not necessarily worth 10. overall, the service was great and its a fun place to try with friends and family, but not everything is worth the price on the menu. still, i might just come back to try some of their other desserts."
Halftime Pizza,5,very good every week im there if you go one time you will go every time...
China King,4,"seating, charging areas, best location in downtown boston. its a great location and near shopping."
North Street Grille,4,"sushi wasnt the best definitely had better in the city. but, it wasnt bad sushi at all. has a large menu with lots of options. peking ravioli was good."
Linguine's Italian Eatery,5,"if you are the kind of person who likes atmosphere when they go out to a bar, then wink and nod is the right place for you.styled in the fashion of speakeasies from the 1920s, wink and nod is the place you either go with friends or significant others if you have a hankering to feel fancy. for the most part, everything is awesome about this place. the drinks are strong yet delicious try the ivana if you want something that a little sweet but will give you a buzz, the food is mouthwateringly good. considering the prices, you are definitely getting your moneys worth. however, order with caution, i had two drinks and a small app and it came to about 40 without including tip. do i regret it? no, but i wasnt totally prepared going in that this place was going to be on the pricey side.while i would love to give this place five stars, there is one grievance that i need to air here the service moves at a snails pace. when the waitresses are there, they are very attentive approachable, but they seem to vanish for long periods of time .and i went on a monday.would i go back there? yes, absolutely. but next time im gonna plan out what i want to eat and wont try and schedule myself for something to do afterwards."
Eagle Hill Cafe,4,paid for turkey sausage on my sandwichand they didnt have any. they gave me hash browns instead and they werent cooked properly.
Sarku Japan,5,"dinner reviewafter living in boston for over a year, i had heard so many good things about the seafood over at row 34 and i finally made it out. this place is typical seaport. highceilings, loud, lively ambiance, goodlooking people wanting to see and be seen. thats not to detract from the food but just expect this type of experience when you come here. dont expect to get seated right away either, this place gets busy. we had to wait 20 minutes even with a reservation.food ive said it before and ill say it again. i love the small menu that this place has. its both diverse and shows that they focus on a few good things. we ordered a lot so i will break it down into what we would order again and what we wouldnt.what i would get again you can tell it was a good meal by the majority of items being in this categorytuna crudo  do yourself a favor and just get this. its one of the best things ive eaten in a long time. the fish melts in your mouth and whatever it sits on top of is delicious.crispy brussels sprouts  some of the bestfried brussels sprouts ive ever had. i feel like these are in right now and row 34 does them so well.crab cake  my friend who is a selfproclaimed crab cake connaisseur said this is one of the best ones hes ever had.croquettes  i typically dont like croquettes but these saltpollock croquettes were delicious, just the right balance of fish and everything else.lobster rolls  ok these probably are not worth 34 for the amount of lobster you get on them but they are still good. the buttered and toasted rolls they come on are delicious and the lobster is obviously fresh. we got both the brown butter version and the classic version and i was surprised that i liked the cold, classic version better. i just like that it comes with more elements than the warm butter version.what i would skip onion rings  nothing special, i wish they were a bit crispier the desserts  we got both the apple crisp which was honestly underwhelming apples were on the harder side and the chocolate chip cookies were warm but they werent special either. save dessert for elsewhere.overall, a great experience and when friends are in town and wanting to have some fresh seafood in a lively environment, ill take them to row 34."
Chicken Lou's Inc,5,best value around
Le Foyer Bakery,5,"food fit for a king, obviously."
Pho Viet’s,4,"not worth the hype.  great atmosphere, okay pizza."
The Sevens Ale House,5,"the booth we sat in was falling apart making for a very uncomfortable dining experience. the service was fine, food was okay. we ordered truffle fries and it upset both our stomachs. the ambiance and night vibe on a fri or sat night is phenomenal though."

Beijing Cafe,5,great food and great staff there!

Woody's Pizza,3,super delicious
Bristol Restaurant and Bar,5,"good place for salads, sandwiches, burgers and complete meals.  i think the price payed for salads are average but everything else seemed a bit overpriced. i had the cobb salad. if youre a vegetarian, theyll allow you to replace a meat item. instead of the ham, i had avocado but was charged for it.  salads are of average size.  the service was excellent and friendly."

Upham's House Of Pizza,5,i tried to look at their menu online...good luck.  they seem more interested in getting your personal info and not letting you see any menu.
Mirchi Nation-Indian Kitchen,5,incredible greek food and great service. you cant go wrong on the menu and the wine list is also very solid. theres usually a wait so get there early. if baklava is on the dessert menu definitely grab some.
Sultan's Kitchen,5,the food had nice flavor but the service wasnt too good. our waitress served me a riesling that wasnt chilled and when my 2 lb lobster arrived delivered by someone that wasnt a server i was told i had to wait for my server to come cut and clean it....by then my baked potato was like warm and the lobster had sat a few minutes. she offered a new potato but at that point...i just wanted to eat.
Chutneys Boston,4,food mediocre
wagamama,4,"very unique ambiance and place is always lit!! staff is amazing, food and drinks were on point and would to visit this place again for sure."

No Relation,5,fried food goodness
Clover Food Lab,3,"we had a bad experience the last time here. complained to district manager, and he sent a coupon for free breakfast. came today for the free breakfast. good thing it was free, as the waitress gave our plates to another table!! this was the second time that has happened at this location!! service and management are definitely lacking at this dennys."
Boston Bay Pizza 3,4,"i would not call the chicken wings chicken wingsmore like chicken tenders with spicy sauce. otherwise, was good!"
Miel Brasserie,5,"the food here is awesome. everytime ive been here, the food is great. the server we have has always been super nice and friendly. i higy recommend  eating here."
Boston Tavern,4,this is a cool place to go early in the night as it gets really packed the later you go. they have three floors and im usually on the arcade for bowling floors. the bowling is fun and newer so setup is easy. the arcade is fun as well. the big downside is that everything is way too expensive. a few hours here can easily run you 200 between you and a friend. they also expect you to tip to set up a bowling lane which i think is total bs.

DiVito Brothers Italian Pizzeria,4,"a delicious mexican bit! not expensive for boston  8 a big burrito, 11,49 three enchiladas, and a very friendly staff. great options for vegetarians and vegans. a nice space to eat inside. dont forget to ask for the hot sauce, the green one which is just mild, and the red one which is spicy."
Beneventos,5,"one of my favorite neighborhood spots! always a great meal, clean and social distancing is spot on!"
Tiki Rock,5,"presentation was good. service was 710the food look well put.the calamari was good 910  deducted a point for the skimpy serving.the seafood platter 2101 point deducted for the clams casino.deducted 6 points for the non existent seasoning, disappointed.if you loooove bland food. this is the place for you.you gotta try every place once pun  onceshould have known the food was going to be bland when i saw the clientele in there."
Pan Asia Restaurant,5,"i wanted to love the food herei really did! yet writing a glowing review for tawakal halal cafe would be a egregious ask. the people were sweet, but the service was unreasonably slow. we were the only people in the restaurant and somehow to go orders which were placed well after us arrived before us. additionally, we had to waive the server down numerous times to get her attention. this would have been all find and well if the food tasted great. it did not. what did the food taste like? nothing. it was bland and lacked the soul bon appetite   boston globe raved about. make a better choice than i did."

Danas Grillroom,1,great halibut and haddock
Olive Garden,4,"a little expensive but absolutely amazing. apparently theres a few in italy and one of them is like... twice the size of this one?this place is fascinating, tons of overpriced goods imported straight from italy. endless amounts of food shops, a selfseat restaurant in the middle and a full size restaurant in the back. this place gets packed, especially since its attached to the mall  you can also enter from the street side. if youve never been to one its totally worth a tripvisit.we sat down at the restaurant in the middle and ordered a few afternoon snacks  di salumi e formaggi charcuterie sampler, burrata with pesto basil, and the melanzane alla parmigiana. everything was excellent, and brought out relatively fast. we were lucky and happened to find two empty seats at one of the counters, but there were plently of people standing around the entire time looking for somewhere to sit. seems like its a little too expensive to make this your regular grocery shop.... but could be nice for a special event or special meal, as they literally carry everything."
Tutti Frutti,5,"great subs, well cooked, definitely my new goto! staff are extremely overworked, they seem do their best to be polite."
South End Buttery,5,"great allyoucaneat from a menu, including sashimi and many other options. they do lose parts of an order sometimes, so just check and reorder if needed."

The Bebop,5,great pizza waiter great.
BEERWORKS (No. 3 Boston/Canal),5,quick food done right
Doughboy Donuts & Deli,5,"super overrated. the burger was underwhelming, the meat was okay, not that juicy and doesnt have a lot of flavor. the other ingredients in the sandwich werent fresh.and the over all presentation of the sandwich wasnt any good, like seriously guys, mcdonalds sandwiches looks way better! even the way you wrap the sandwiches! aluminum foil!!!?? what year is this?the fries looked awful and tasted worse than it looks! felt like eating cardboard! and the best part is that they come in a paper cup!!!and on top of all that, the tables werent clean enough!"
Hidden Kitchen,3,good food and continually packed.
Joe’s Waterfront,1,"the food was excellent, but the service is soso"
Cunard Tavern,5,"great oysters, cocktails  service. this place also has a pretty cool and chill atmosphere. the only downside to this place is the fact that for 1016 you can get two overwhelmingly bland and completely forgettable tacos. if you order something other than tacos i think anyone can easily find this place quite enjoyable."

Sweet Life,4,free parking. great food. excellent service
SA PA,5,"get there before they open and line up, you can to avoid the wait, or go wayyy ahead like 3 hours ahead of when you want to have your meal and put in your name. then walk around the north end and wait. the flapjack, pancake was surprisingly the really good. the lobster roll is worth the pricey. and its huge compared to other lobster rolls ive had in the past."

Papa's Pizza Company,4,"few restaurants in the us correctly pair food and wine like troquet. over 40 wines are offered in 2 and 4 oz. pours, along with wine pairings for each dish on the menu.  oysters for starters, a nice combo of locals and west coast, and a bottle of crisp meursault. the soft shell crab, paired with a peekytoe crab salad was in season so that was a must, as was the very fresh dover sole thanks, british airways. go for the ginger souffle for dessert"

Pho Common,5,had a nice breakfast
Mi Pueblito Restaurant,3,"for the more refined jazz lover, beehive is the spot to go. the decor will make you feel like youve slipped into a chic bohemian retreat even don draper would be spotted at. it can be hard to get a table and its not always easy to situate yourself near the stage. thankfully, the acoustics and ambiance can carry performers croonings throughout the space. if youre thirsty, dont forget to try the honey beer! after all, where did you think the name came from? this delicacy is so popular, patrons have been known to call and beg for kegs to no avail. for now, the only way you can get your fix is if you stop in yourself!"
Island Creek Oyster Bar,5,"after my shift as an rn nurse, theres nothing i like more then coming to my thai for vegan cakes. great, fast service and good lighting."
Boston Sail Loft,5,"first, most remarkable was how fast and efficient the service was during friday lunch hour. second, dont be put off by the construction outside, i walked past it once before i saw it the second time. third, this is the first ramen ive tried outside of chicago that has deighted me as much as my favorite ramen shops in chi town obviously ive never been to japan.for the purpose of true comparison i kept it simple yokohama tonkatsu and pakchee salad. the broth was rich and complex, just as it should be. the pork was tender. if i were to do it over i would have ordered some extra toppings. size wise this was a little smaller than im used to but i still couldnt finish all the noodles. and the cold brew iced matcha green tea was a nice suprise as i ordered it without looking at the menu and thought i was just getting green tea. they served it with simple syrup on the side but i didnt need it."
La Tapatia Taqueria,5,avacado toast

P.F. Chang's,5,great food.  some of the best tempura i have ever had.
Mario’s Pizzeria,5,"as others have mentioned, garlic n lemons is very clean and the service is very friendly and polite. i ordered a mixed shawarma plate spicy chicken and spicy beef with tabouleh, rice pilaf, and garlic sauce, adding a falafel. i also asked for some spicy sauce on top. for dessert, i ordered a piece of baklava.i havent seen shawarma sliced so thinly before, which isnt a bad thing. i found that being so thinly sliced and dressed with sauce, i never had a dry bite, nor one that felt too saucy. the flavors were perhaps less intense than other excellent shawarma plates that ive eaten, but were as balanced and if anything, more nuanced. though i am always a bit self conscious after eating a lot of parsley and garlic sauce, i wasnt swimming in my own garlic breath after eating it. anyway, it was really, really good. the falafel was good, though something of an afterthought. it is probably excellent when fresh.the baklava, though tasty, had the syrup poured on it before being placed in the package, meaning that it was not as crisp nor as bright as other baklava that ive had, but still really tasty.i found the price to be on par with other middle eastern counterserve restaurants in the area, meaning that while reasonable, i wouldnt call it cheap. all told, i paid 1718 for my meal, which seems fair to me, though i would have felt like i got better value if the baklava and the falafel were fresher. overall, i certainly recommend this place."
Chicked's Chicken & Grill,5,overpriced mediocre food
Bostonia Public House,5,"food was okay. nothing special and somewhat bland, service was slow."
The Chateau Restaurant Norwood,5,excellent food. small place. authentic taste! affordable
Labaredas Brazilian BBQ & Bar,5,we eat there

Brown Sugar Cafe,5,hands down. best pizza
Krazy Jakes,5,out of stock of several.things alot of times
99 Restaurants,5,"man if you love oysters and fresh fish with great wine, beer, and cocktails this is the spot for you.  island creeks raw bar delivers 1216 of new englands finest oysters along with crudo, shellfish and, of course,  fresh caught daily selections of fish.  check out their sister resraraunt, row 34, near seaport too!"

D'Angelo Grilled Sandwiches,5,it was pretty good.
Pete's Dockside,5,"there are two experiences that union oyster house seems to be good at. one involves walking up to the semicircular bar and downing a few trays of oysters with a pint of sam adams. the other includes sitting in a nook somewhere in the restaurant and ordering some new england comfort food. either way you wont be challenged, and thats not really why you came here anyway."
Montien Thai Restaurant,3,"the food was good. portions were better than expected i was worried id have to eat after but left feeling full with 2 plates per person. pricey, but couldve been worse. my issue was the atmosphere. it was super loud and frentic. for a bar, sure. but for a seated meal at a pricey restaurant, no. was also seated 30min after my reservation party of 2."
Guira y Tambora,4,we stopped in for a drink and the staff was inattentive and unfriendly. i would never go back.
DiVito Brothers Italian Pizzeria,5,always an amazing experience! delicious food and great service!

Boston Market,4,"yummy burgers, skip the onion rings though"
DiVito Brothers Italian Pizzeria,5,"my last food stop in 2020. the restaurant is still open for dine in. i was assigned to this wellquarantined corner table, which was an  interesting experience. the freakfrappe is what make them stand out on social media. i ordered the smore one following my servers advice. it tastes really silky. for my burger, i had the jubmo. the portion was huge, and i wasnt able to finish. it is also good, but not so special. you may think it is a little pricy at first, but considering its location, you cant blame too much. its not a restaurant that worths a longdistance travel just for their burgers, but if you happen to shopping on davis square on weekends, i think its an excellent spot to relax and have some great food."
Winsor Dim Sum Café,2,best mac and cheese in the city.
Boston Market,4,they took my two favorites off yhe menu.  meatball sub and pesto pasta

Wong's,5,"great people, great food."
Carmelina's,4,"i really wanted to like this place but when you pay 16 for a cocktail plus tip and you basically get a glass of ice... not ok. drinks are very expensive and so bad see picture and you also get a lot of extra charges on your bill at the end. food was just average, not great and i paid 20 for a just ok cuban sandwich with chips from a packet. besides the cool art deco vibe i dont see any reason why return to this place. also, we booked a table downstairs at 2pm for brunch and when we arrived at 205pm the place was not even open and we had to wait till they got things ready."

Amrheins Restaurant,5,"its good for what you expect. you shouldnt be expecting a super fancy dinner based on menu price, but the food and hot sauces are good enough for a quick texmex dinner. the drinks are comparatively cheaper but good enough if you dont want to shell out a lot of money. id recommend the chimichanga or enchiladas"

PABU Izakaya Boston,5,"definitely a pricey meal for 2, even without alcohol, but we knew that before coming here to eat. the quality of the food and service was excellent. we were fortunate enough to just walk in at 830pm on a saturday and be seated. our seats were reserved at 10pm, but we had no issue ordering and eating without the feeling of being rushed. would come back again for tasty seafood."

Stephi's on Tremont,5,my place to go... love the new improvement as well
Revolution Health kitchen,3,"great food.  smaller selection on weekends.  meat more often than not is overdone and hard to chew perhaps just from being in the warming trays too long.  recently they havent had their signature lemonade drinks.  overall, i keep going because the combination of mediterranean flavors is too delicious to pass up, but if a competitor comes to town, i may be switching my usual spot."
Jade Garden,5,"moes was catered to my workplace. in my opinion, it was all disgusting gross mexican food. wasnt even appetizing at all. i even bit on something hard which messed up my tooth, and the food was all pretty much soft.  so not sure what was the cause.i would not go to this restaurant."

Picco,4,"unfortunately i visited the restaurant with a groupon voucher. the moment we said we have a voucher, they started treating us like someone went there to beg food. how mean? we actually paid for the service right..all the staffs there have strong accent which is really difficult to understand but thats okay. problem was their unprofessional behaviour.food was not bad..most of their menu has raw fish or meat so we couldnt make a choice from sushi, again thats our problem not theirs.now, our voucher clearly said we must purchase one item which will be covered under 20 which we paid for, but they forced us to order a second item which is as expensive as the 1st one and we did.and at the end we had a a lot of leftover which we asked them to parcel. the staff came with a box to our table and started pouring the dish in front of us. actually we have not seen anything like that before in a restaurant.its written over there that the wifi is free, when we asked the staff for wifi password for fetching our voucher, staff replied very weirdly giving a sharp look as if we went there to steal the entire bandwidth or asked them a favor. god.. by this point we were extremely irritated but tried maximum not to show that.after paying the bill the same staff said we have to write the tip amount..yes that we have to do but this is the first time we are hearing any staff demanding us to write the exact amount they say.. huh??? literally she asked us to write 7 in it. tip is a gratitude we give for a pleasant service, not something they can demand with the amount..my god..and she even said if we write the amount it will not be charged to our card.. very funny who are they trying to fool? still we controlled our anger and paid her tip.. looking at the bill we gave she said only this much she really wanted to throw it.. my god the worstest experience i ever had from a restaurant.highly not recommended.p.s  from the other reviews i feel they appeared to be good to the people wthout a voucher "

jm Curley,4,"dont go there if youre in a hurry theres a long wait unless you call in or order online. i waited half hour for 2 fish  chips, one with salad. a little price for the portions. also, fish kind of bland not alot of seasoning, but it was hot, i liked that. the cashierserver was great to repear customers some he remembered by name. however, he seemed a little annoyed with me, the phone ringing and the delivery guy. my husband suggested we go there since we were in the area and hungry. i didnt feel very welcomed nor was he that attentive to me, i had to keep repeating myself. lastly, i am a firm believer of first come first served but i didnt like standing there looking at my food waiting for it to be bagged and given to me while he packed up delivery orders. why not get me out the door if my stuff is ready and im right here? i wont be back but that probably doesnt matter they seem to get good business."

7 Nana Japanese Steakhouse,5,"marliave is classy but oldschool boston feeling. it feels distinguished but not stuffy inside.the cocktail list is fantastic and offers some really well thought out drinks. there arent any novice bartenders here. they know what theyre doing which means you end up with a well crafted drink that is truely worth the 11 price tag.i went for restaurant week and was floored. they had so many choices and didnt dumbdown their food. it made me come back several times.the muscles are delicious with a broth leaving you wanting to lick the bowl. ive had a lot of mac  cheeses and this is probably my favorite in the city. the fish  chips is delightfully crispy without being greasy. there is just always something that catches my eye on the menu.the best thing about their menu is that you can get 1 oysters during happy hour, or a burger for 14, risotto for 18, all the way up to osso buco for 28. truely something for everyone at a place with such style."
Upham's House Of Pizza,4,great burger and fries!

The Playwright Bar,4,"the food here is simple and done well. come hungry because the portions are large and heavy, but you probably wont have trouble finishing your meal. fried chicken and pulled pork mac n cheese were great dishes and the rumwhiskey cocktails they have are prepared very well. they play loud punkrap music so it wasnt the most ideal place for a date, but thats really on me for not looking into it further and we still really enjoyed our meal.the only downside is the price. 100 bill for 2 people that only got 1 drink each. i would go again, but probably would skip the appetizer since the main course is filling enough."
The Green Dragon Tavern,3,"after a show at the calderwood theater, my son chose this restaurant to celebrate his birthday. the food was absolutely delicious. after appetizers of fried zucchini chips with tazeki and spicy cauliflower in tomatoe sauce  which his girlfriend, who is greek commented that its so close to her fathers recipe, an roka salad  arrugula, pear and walnut salad with a greek cheese  we had grilled octopus with oregano, olive oil and lemon, braised beef with orzo and braised short ribs. capping the night off, we shared a light and creamy yogurt with fruit, walnuts and honey. heres to the birthday boy! the house threw in a shot for each of us, of a grapeskin liquor! cheers!"

Casa De Nana,4,"tldr if you are looking for a quaint italian restaurant with amazing service, great quality food, and tiramisu, this is your go to place.it can be difficult to find a great place to eat with the amount of restaurants in the north end, but please add this to your list.you wont be able to find a sign with a name, making it feel like a hidden gem. as soon as you walk in, you are in the intimately sized dining room. we made reservations ahead of time to ensure seating for five. since the location is on the smaller side, i would not recommend going with a large group unless you call ahead.we were immediately served water with warm rolls and olives in olive oil. then we were served calamari, which were crusted and fried perfectly. i ordered the wild mushroom ragu and it was creamy, unctuous goodness. you can tell the pasta was freshly made as well. to end the meal, we had tiramisu and it was perfect. thank you for the amazing meal, i will be back."

House of Blues Boston,4,"this place is inside a shopping plaza, but has amazing food.  all 4 of us at the table had something different and all 4 plates were clean.  french dip, tuna salad, asian noodles and steak tips.  drinks were good too.  wait staff was helpful with food allergies and refilling water glasses.  we did have to ask for bread, and it was worth it.  great value and great taste."

Whiskey's,4,long drive thru wait time
Kantin,5,"avocado toast with burrata cheese. finger lickin good. but im all seriousness, ive been to this bar a few times and usually just go for cocktails. no complaints on the bar service and flavor of the cocktails  my goto is usually the gin and tonic but as you can see, their bloodys are a good option for sunday funday. last time i went i also got the avocado toast  while i usually wont order food i can make myself, i gave this one a try. the burrata cheese was a game changer to this easy dish and the cheese sprinkled on top was an excellent addition. if youre looking to grab a drink and eat a snack, i just gave you two perfect options. their menu has phenomenal looking options and have never ordered something i didnt enjoy. brunch  drinks  snacks and small plates  for more on boston foods visit hereforthef00d on instagram."

Bond,3,"look. its not cheap. and its a salad. but its delicious. there are a lot of things that can be added to it to fit your taste if vegetables arent your thing, or you can get additional proteins if you dont think itll be filling enough for you. ive liked every one i have tried  kale caesar, guacamole greens, and the earth bowl. why only three? because ive gotten the earth bowl every time since i ordered it. it does get busy at high volume hours, but the line does move pretty quickly. because, you know. its a salad. they offered call in ordering, but there was something wrong with...well i have no idea. but it took a lot longer than the people walking in, so that was a little frustrating. im not sure id go with that option again, to be honest. i dont envision myself coming down here during weekday lunch as it is a bit out of the way."
Spinelli's Pasta And Pastries,4,"located on state street, crush is a great lunch destination for the work crowd and because the pizza cooks up fast the wait is never long.  limited seating means you are probably getting your grub to go.  pizza is very tasty, thin, and maybe just a little greasy, but this is pizza so relax.  good options for sandwiches, chicken, and on occasion homemade cookies and other treats near the register."

Coco Leaf,5,"there are so many choices on the north end it was very had to decide where to go to dinner.  we chose panza based on the reviews that we were seeing and had a wonderful dinner.  panza is a small restaurant making great food, so my number one recommendation is to make a reservation.the food here is definitely a treat, cooked in traditional italian style and in perfect proportions.  we started out the night with the bruschetta.  the combination of the fresh tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and goat cheese was vert tasty.  we noticed that both restaurants we visited here served the bruschetta on two long pieces of bread instead of smaller individual portions so we had to cut it into small pieces which with the crusty bread was more of a challenge than you would think.the food came out hot, was plated attractively and tasted great.  i had the beef and veal tortellini based on the suggestion of the waiter because i was having a hard time deciding what i wanted to eat.  the tortellini were definitely hand made, were nice and big, and the beef and veal filling was flavorful.  the sauce was very yummy and there was a nice pile of sauteed mushrooms on the center of the plate.the wine and beer menu were nice and had plenty of selection.  panza was a great dining experience for us, and i would recommend it to you if you are looking for a small personal experience than some of the larger places in the community."

Pho Viet’s,5,"so so so so good!!! food came out fast! service was okay. felt like we were waiting a while for checks, water refills, etc. being from the south something ive noticed about boston chinese places in general is they do not serve rice with their meals. i got the red sox roll, highly recommend!!! we also got steamed pot stickers, ponzu sauce was not my preference so used sweet chili sauce for dipping instead. for meals, got general geau which was also delicious."

Pikaichi,5,"translated by google even if i went without a lunch break, there were four seats and people kept coming in. premeal cornbread and butter delicious. the clam chowder bowl is served by four people. the largesized lobster steamed food was unfortunately eaten in moderation, and considerably cheaper in korea. i added an extra seafood platter, but the amount was surprisingly high, leaving some french fries. i think the rice is better for the side of the lobster. overall taste is alright?original   4      .   .     4   .              .          .     .   ?"
The Paramount,3,"the hot pot and service were both fantastic. the restaurant was clean and well appointed, and we had a great waiter. we ended up doing split broth with the kimchi and the tonkotsu, and i was seriously impressed but im also biased because i love kimchi. the meat and vegetables were a great quality, and were absolutely delicious. the only thing i was not a huge fan of was i ordered a green tea, and its served in a glass cup! in and of itself, its not a huge problem, but it does mean you have to wait a while for it all to cool so you can pick up the glass. overall a great place, and ill definitely end up going back!"
Chicked's Chicken & Grill,4,excellent crispy thin crust pizza.
Little Asia Restaurant,4,i was coerced into splitting my bill with strangers at the next table over.  my group was mistakenly given a combined check with the next person over and we were threatened by the owner since we were not willing to split the bill with them.  dont patronize businesses that bully their customers.

West End Johnnie’s,4,"one the best places around my job , i love it ...the worker are very friendly."

Dirty Water Dough Company,5,food is great. especially loved the minestrone soup. however be aware that if you do not order at least one item per person there is an 8 per person splitting fee.
Stefano Sub,5,"pizza is burned see pictures and tastes just okay, nothing special. one of the waitresses woman in late 30s or early 40s just slides the plate on your table, doesnt even stop to place it  shes too busy for that. another waitress doesnt stop to get your order for another beer and prefers to hear it from the distance. weird dynamic here, they act like they are doing you a favor. still trying to figure out if its the amount of cop badges on the walls or the age of this place that contributes to this places reputation, but i wouldnt rate their pizza so highly."
Nico Ristorante,4,good food
Old Tyme Italian Cuisine,5,"i had it for the first time today and it was delicious! i had the thai peanut bowl and hummus. i ordered the falafel salad and they gave me another one that i couldnt eat, so i guess i will be coming back!"

Quic Pic BBQ,5,great drinks and crowd!
Wingz & Tingz,2,"theres no way i can give this place 5 stars.  the food was great, my server was great.  the wait and the extremely poor estimate of how long we would be waiting was unacceptable and appears to be the norm.  quoted at 45 minutes for a party of 3...fine.  almost two hours later, theres a mob of 9 hangry people waiting outside, every one of us long past our wait times.  no updates, no snacks to tide us over, no bar service to at least get a drink while we wait.  the overall experience was poor maybe because i was standing outside in the cold the entire time.  im glad i went but have no plans on every going back."
Pastoral ARTisan Pizza + Kitchen + Bar,4,this place is very unprofessional. i ordered online and wrote on the instruction box come up to 2nd floor apt  for the driver. driver gets here and calls me to come down. i explained to him i have a newborn he needs to come up and he said he cant because of security purposes. i told him if he cant come up then forget it. i called the store and some allie girl claiming to be a supervisor said drivers go up at times.she said it really depends. really?!

BFC: Boston Fried Chicken And Burritos,5,hella overpriced but cute place with really good and unique food
Peach Farm,5,"updated review my original review, written a few months after they opened, was quite positive.  a subsequent visit last night offers a different opinion.   despite the restaurant being nearly empty on a thursday evening, we were seated in a hidden cubby hole on the second floor, invisible to the staff, and basically ignored for 1520 minutes.  at some point, our bored disengaged waitress strolled by to ask what do you want, and returned sometime later with our diet cokes, no straws.  our meals were lackluster in the extreme.  soggy quesadilla sitting in a pool of cold mystery liquid, almost inedible.   and fajitas on a cold plate, no sizzling, no freshness.  limp and likely reheated vegetables alongside cold chicken pieces.  possibly just an off night.  but wed think twice about returning, especially considering how many great options are nearby."

Crave Chinatown,4,"for those who work at mgh, i can see how harvard gardens would be a regular spot.  but there is really no reason to meet here unless you work within a 5 minute walk away.  its a nice enough place, bustling on a week night, bar pretty much full.  a much older crowd, families, professionals, people in scrubs grabbing a drink with colleagues after work.  one of those places that if its nearby youre tired, you might whisper with resignation, itll do."

Lucca Restaurant,5,the food and service is phenomenal!
Uno Due Go,5,"this review should be 5 stars because the food is really good. however, i couldnt get past the dining experience which is what brought the rating down for me. if you happen to have the unfortunate seating that facs towards the kitchen about half of the seats,  you will be forced to view the glaring interior of the only unisex bathroom each time the neverending parade of people enter and exit as you try to enjoy your meal. it was so distracting and unappetizing  yuk!  the interior of the actual restaurant is rather bland and the bar is in the upstairs dining area so be prepared to have tvs to distract you as well.   i didnt visit the downstairs dining area but it looked dark from what i could see.  i ordered  was served the ricotta stuffed zucchini flowers, which were good.  my bf ordered a ceasar and they forgot to serve. when they removed my appetizer plate he asked about his salad.  they admitted they forgot and eventually brought it late. i had read many reviews about great service and how the manager checked on customers satisfaction,  but not in our case. our server apologized, but there was no attempt to make up for their mistake and our having to eat separately. its a shame because my amatriciana was legit with guanciale not pancetta!  and the seafood was delish."

Neptune Oyster,3,"subpar pizza with subpar employees  after midnight  the employees do not care for the common person and overcharge everything. zero selection at that point. rude and dismissive, generally"
Moko Japanese Cuisine,5,"really its the hostess fault. the hostess was incredibly rude to my wife. we should have just left when she behaved that way to her, but it was late and we were hungry. aside from that the food was tremendously oversalted so the bad food added insult to injury. i think the mongolian beef was the only thing that was okay, but the sides of rice just arent cooked well or perhaps it is just old rice cooked in the morning or the day before so since i was there late at night we got stale rice?. this was a few months back and i just remembered i wanted to leave this review so that your hostess are trained not to treat customers like were trash especially since were minorities, and we are well aware that we never see anglos get treated with the slightest hint of disrespect at any restuarant, and certainly not a pf changs. ive been to pf changs in stamford ct, and seattle wa, and this is the first time i had a bad experience. needless to say ill never go back."

Da Vinci Bistro,5,one of the best pizzas in town.  hands down great place

by CHLOE. - Back Bay,5,"we entered at 950pm for a quick bite and respite from one of the hottest days in boston in recent times and hoped to catch our breath for ten minutes. however, the guy at the counter was extremely rude and wanted us to strictly do take out and leave, as they were going to close. what happened to customer service? i can understand a sitdown restaurant where you need to place an order and wait, but this is fast food served right in front of you. another lady at the counter said it should be okay and allowed us to sit. hence the extra stars."
Jim's Pizza,5,"3 words, must go here. authentic, no bs, legit thai cuisine. you should definitely try the drunken noodles and the sprig rolls here. the service is pretty good. it is a tad bit overpriced, but definitely worth a try.ambience, taste, price, service 45"

Rino's Place,4,"looking forward to a sunday omelet breakfast.  instead, i got oily and overcooked food.  the omelet was cooked in too much oil and the asparagus, tomatoes were undercooked although the brie and mushrooms not truffles were at least warm.  the toast so over toasted it was inedible.  the replacement biscuit was dense and hard.  i didnt know one could improperly cook breakfast potatoes, these cooks have that ability.  save your money and go to mcdonalds for something more nutritious."
Boston fried chicken,1,everything is awesome! they will customize based on preference and have a shellfish free menu!
California Pizza Kitchen at Prudential,5,excellent wine menu...its extensive. they also had ciders but the beer list was short! i went early so it was a 40 crowd.

Umai,1,"came by a few nights ago on our first night in boston as it is one of our favorite places to eat in the north end. it was pretty busy for a thursday night, so i would highly recommend reservations for any night. we started off with a couple house salads and the calamari. for dinner we ordered the homemade fusilli with quattro formaggio sauce and chicken, chicken umberto and the shrimpscallops ala vodka. all were absolutely wonderful! you feel like part of the family from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave!"
Ba Lẹ Restaurant,5,good food. need more options though
The Pongal,5,dinner at the bar is the best
by CHLOE. - Fenway,4,the food here was so delicious.  the kids meal was given just as much care as my burger was.  the burger was by far the best i have had. the flavor combinations were spot on and the burger was huge.  even reheated it was still delicious although fresh was out of this world. the drink was a little light on the alcohol but was fun. the homemade chips were good as well.
Darbar,5,ordered a roll up greek with chicken very ...i didnt care for the other roll up i ordered the other day caesar w ...ill stick with the greek..

FiRE+iCE,5,elevated meatloaf to a whole new level
Gourmet China House,5,ramen was terrible and had cold chicken in it. noodles tasted like packdged ramen. egg was plain not even tea egg. wait was over 2 hours. tori karaga was not friyed.it was very chrey. i would avoid this place and find somewhere better and more worth your money.
Bristol Restaurant and Bar,5,"really its the hostess fault. the hostess was incredibly rude to my wife. we should have just left when she behaved that way to her, but it was late and we were hungry. aside from that the food was tremendously oversalted so the bad food added insult to injury. i think the mongolian beef was the only thing that was okay, but the sides of rice just arent cooked well or perhaps it is just old rice cooked in the morning or the day before so since i was there late at night we got stale rice?. this was a few months back and i just remembered i wanted to leave this review so that your hostess are trained not to treat customers like were trash especially since were minorities, and we are well aware that we never see anglos get treated with the slightest hint of disrespect at any restuarant, and certainly not a pf changs. ive been to pf changs in stamford ct, and seattle wa, and this is the first time i had a bad experience. needless to say ill never go back."

Mare Oyster Bar,4,"food is decent, too much potatoes starch on the fried chickens. definitely prefer korean fried chickens from bonchon. good atmosphere for friend gatherings."
Granary Tavern,5,"been here 3 times now and loved the food each time. now, to be honest, i got the aglio olio and the calamari appetizer  all three times. would highly recommend and say yes, its worth the wait.most recently, i ended up waiting 2 hours to get seated on a friday night that may be excessive. but if you go on a weekdayodd hours your wait should hopefully be shorter.once youre seated theres incredibly fast and friendly service. the large sizes comes out in the pan they cook it in, filled with squid  and garlic goodness.mobilitythe restaurant describes itself as snug, its a really small place and minimal room to move around, let alone let a wheelchair pass through. ive never even attempted to use the restroom there, but im sure someone with a mobility device or a wheelchair would have a considerably difficult time getting to it.as for seating, theres no wheelchair seating, but theres no steps to enter and if you let the waiter know that you need a specific seat right by the entrance , they would most likely accommodate you."
The Upper Crust Pizzeria,5,very good noodle bowls. must try
Boston Kitchen,5,"gimmicky and way over priced its one of those buffet places where you fill up a bowl with raw meats, veggies, fruits, seasoningssauces and then wait in a line to watch them cook it at a giant hibachi in the center of the room. i guess could be fun for kids, but it is expensive for one person let alone a whole family. not sure if special pricing for kids"

Cappy's Pizza & Subs,4,"i went to santarpios the other day and i got lamb tips.  they use shoulder cut colorado lamb and they are cooked to perfection. they can be chewy at times because of the shoulder cut, but are very flavorful. i think the lamp tips are 10.  i also like the sausages, best ive ever had.  every order comes with a chunk of bread and hot peppers.they also have excellent pizza."
Dirty Water Dough Company,4,"the food is decent, but not sure what the hype is. my gobi manchurian was on the sweeter side, which didnt go too well with the rice. they offered to redo it and make it more savory, so points for that."

Royal Tavern,5,"a favorite spot to grab a quick bite before seeing a movie or something in the nearby theater district.big fan of the bowls if youre looking for takeout. the small bowl is a meal and the medium is good for leftovers. if youre out and about, the pair of mini burritos are great for snacking.really good local company literally, boloco is short for boston local company that takes care of their employees, helps out in the community, and has a really great, affordable menu."
Yellow Door Taqueria,5,the taco salad was the best. rivals any mexican restaurant. the hamburger was cook perfectly. my daughters ceased wrap was delicious she said. we all had to get doggy bags as the portions were huge. the only reason not 5 stars is the onion rings and french fries appeared to be from frozen.

Love Art Sushi,5,"this place was subpar, and overall was an underwhelming experience. go if you must for the desserts, but definitely not for the drinks too intensely alcoholginger, the service, or the main dishes. i find it a little difficult to give a good review, because what kind of restaurant in chinatown doesnt provide chopsticks, and then ignores you when you ask for them? this one. one of their noodle dishes had a really odd gritty texture to the sauce.the good things were the sriracha honey chicken and matcha ma call it cube toast, but the most exciting thing about the cube toast was the presentation.it was mostly disappointing, since i went in with such high expectations. the idea was cute, the interior was cute, the food was kinda okay at best and the service was awful."

KT Grill,5,"i love brueggers, amazing bagels! always get them toasted!"
Max Brenner,5,"easily located in the south end by the silver line or bus 11 from southie, the cute family style asianamerican fusion restaurant hits the spot. the meals are served in tapas size so you usually can choose between 48 or more plates for 4 people my favorites are usually dumplings, pork lettuce wraps, and korean bbq sloppy joe also complimented with amped up pims cup or 2. mc also caters to the couples out there serving a cheap date night on mon and tues for 45 for the couple with preestablished menus that cant be substituted and reservations are a must."

Gaga Seafood Restaurant,4,"nicely done, cozyvergingoncramped modern italian place that skips the red checked tablecloth and faux rustic motif and instead serves up astonishingly good authentic pizzas from a fiery oven in full view of the dining room, and some really excellent pasta dishes too at a fair price.   there are usually two fresh, house made pastas on offer, along with several dried variety."

Rodey Pizzeria & Pasta,4,"i was a little dissapointed in the chicken, and the split pea soup they both werent cooked enough. but the service was amazing it was one of the best services i ever witnessed. when i complained about my chicken the manager came over to appoligize. so all is forgiven. they had the best, cleanest mussels i ever tasted. for that i would give 5 stars for the service 5 stars. but the flavor profile on the sub par soup and questionable pink chicken. i have to give three. i will be back because i want to taste that burger and i love that its local and kitchen is open until 1 am thats so rare in boston."
Temazcal Tequila Cantina,5,"definitely not authentic mexican food. specially came here with friends for the first time eating out since covid. we reserved a restaurant and got patio seating. salmon was dry and rubbery. swordfish was a tiny portion and had a very unpleasant sauce with it, and the enchiladas were dry and tasteless. overall the drinks were probably the only good part, and the nachos were ok but would not go back, nor recommend it! i wish i had known about the quality of the food  would rather have gone to anywhere else."

Kantin,4,"on our first visit we found the acoustics poor very loud, but the food good and the staff very nice and helpful.we particularly liked the crispy shrimp which was coated in a delicious sauce. the miso black cod was also very good. tempura and a few other items didnt stand out but were good. the prices are high for the fenway, but the fenway is usually low end."

Scollay Square,4,"we sat outside and enjoyed their great pizza! it was very good and light even though it was 90 degrees. also, my husband enjoyed the black cherry soda they serve. i agree with another review that they have pretty waitresses in shape from running up and down stairs but they were not distracting you from service or food. we enjoyed our experience and will go back."

Spring Shabu-Shabu,4,good espresso and sandwiches. student place with fast wifi to get to work!
Peking Garden,4,"this place is really expensive for drinks. i get it. its like 10 bucks for a juice. a juice. but it is absolutely delicious. you think about the amount of fruitsvegetablesother crap that it takes to extract that much juice, in addition to a high powered and expensive machine to extract that juice...and the flavors they are able to combine, and you realize that while it may not be worth it to you, you can at least appreciate the quality they provide. the blue coconut and mocha espresso were delicious. fortunately for me i dont live near here or id be broke."
El Jefe's Taqueria - Boston Common,5,as someone thats worked in customer service i can honestly say ive never more disappointed with the servers attitude. he treated me like i was an inconvenience to him and was extremely rude. no sir i am your customer. i asked for more sour cream and barely got half a teaspoon. absolutely absurd. the only reason theyre even getting a star is because there was a girl that was also preparing my dish and she was extremely polite and sweet.

Rosa Mexicano,1,love the new bistro burger and recommend it every day ..and every shift ..
La Tapatia Taqueria,5,"we usually avoid this place except for brunch a couple of times with tourist friends that wanted to see newbury st. the food here is mediocre and unmemorable.i read rave reviews of their french hot chocolate so went to try it recently. took one sip, and immediately, regret washed over me. i was hit with grainy cocoa powder instead of silky smooth chocolate. definitely not at all how decent hot chocolate should be. i am so confused by all the reviews that say it tastes like a melted chocolate bar because mine in no way resembled that.i hate wasting food though, so i took it home, where i grabbed half a bar of trader joes 85 dark peruvian chocolate that i melted and added to this cup of disappointment. it improved the drink by 1000 but was obviously a hassle. suffice it to say, if you find yourself on newbury craving hot chocolate, do yourself a favor and go to burdicks across the street."
Winsor Dim Sum Café,5,"one word. salmon. they kill it every time, and while yes its pricey definitely worth it. went last year for my birthday and i regretted not getting it then. this last time i went we all got the salmon because its that good. also their meatball is huge and worth it for an appetizer. drink are ok, havent had their wine but they have a pretty big selection. would recommend going during restaurant week for the price."

Serafina,4,"to be fair, the staff was wicked friendly, the pizza was prepared on time, and food portion sizes was good, however i was not a big fan of the pizza, and i love a good slice of greasy thin pizza.  maybe it was the sauce, but it just seemed meh, plain, nothing exciting. i would choose regina pizzeria over penguin next time."

Country Kitchen,4,the double decker and triple decker are disappointing. still get confused why they call it double or triple. the meat are the same. they simply just cut it once or twice.the crispy fries cost 3.5 with only a tiny cup. think twice when u order it. and the fries are supposed to crispy arent they?the chicken sandwich and the sweet potato tater are good.but too much time wait for the waiter. its better if u just go to the kitchen

Giacomo's,5,"i have to say, i was a bit put off with this place initially. first, they couldnt seat me until my guest arrived. i get that when its busy, but at least the upper level was empty. so they invited my to wait at the bar. ok, but when i was ready to be seated the bartender thought it would be easier to close out my bill with him first. easier for whom? and 5 for tea!!!on the other hand, it was really good tea, a nice big pot of hot loose black tea. very nice. and once seated the service was excellent and the food was interesting and delicious. i had the eggs shakshuka with moroccan sausage. great flavours and a nice size serving. my 200lb athletic son had the short ribs eggs benedict which looked challenging even for him.and did i mention the live music? pretty cool for brunch.  overall, even though we got off to a bad start, i really enjoyed the experience. well worth a try."

Mandarin Wilbraham,4,"got the margherita pizza and sweet potato fries. the vibe of the restaurant is a small italian pizzeria that smells great the minute you walk in. the fries were really good and the sauce was well worth getting while you wait for the pizza. i thkught the pizza was pretty good in terms of being thin crust and the plum tomato sauce was fresh. the crust edge was a bit too much imo, but otherwise a solid place for pizza. will def be back to try other specialty pizzas and paninis."
AK's Takeout & Delivery,4,great food spacious place..
Sarku Japan,3,"without any hesitation, the box combo is the way. their chicken fingers are worth going to battle over. accompanied by fries, coleslaw, bread, and some good ol sweet tea, you wont find a more comforting meal on that strip of land. surely a 5 star establishment."
Nick's House of Pizza,4,"wellexecuted hotel food served with breathtaking views out over boston harbor looking at the sumptuous boston skyline.   a few nods to local cuisine like the linecaught block island swordfish and the excellent clam chowder.   on warm summer nights, the harborside patio is glowing with fire pits, drinks, and smores.   a decent number of locals stop by since it is at the terminus of a major walking path from jeffries point."

Bodega Canal,5,not sure why chipotle portions are getting more and more pathetic but they are. also the amount of guac you get for 2.65 extra is a total joke! i keep thinking maybe this time itll be different but nope! doubt theyll fix the issue so likely wont order here again.
Clover Food Lab,3,"this is one of my favorite italian places ever! this place is always crowded, so reservations are a must! such good, authentic italian food. we tried the eggplant appetizer with ricotta, and it was so good. the handmade pasta is always amazing. i got the vodka sauce, and my boyfriend got the carbonara. the pasta is perfectly al dente, and the sauce was incredible! service was good, and we even got a free limoncello shot at the end. always a good time here!"

Sbarro,4,"they were slow, and gave me the happy meal without even closing the box up."
Kindles Wood Fired Brick Oven Pizzeria,4,"hostess was friendly, and the inside is clean and inviting, but our table for two was tiny, and there was a very rowdy group at the bar who were swearing and yelling loudly, and were allowed to carry on, seemingly without being asked to keep it down.  service was slow, and our waitperson fairly unattentive took too long to catch her attention for drinks, check, etc.  food was cooked appropriately, but just bland and unexciting, especially for the prices.   my daughter  had enjoyed her last visit here, so i was definitely hoping for better, but was disappointed."
Koy,4,quick and polite service.  great pizza
Harry’s All American,5,"of the 7 meals brought to the table, one was cold and two were served to the wrong person. although our server was friendly and tried to be engaging, the result was slow service and bad food. even trying to pay the bill was a drawn out process of about 10 minutes trying to get his attention. we left a 20 percent tip because we are good people, but it wasnt warranted. i would never dine here again, and neither should anyone else."
Johnny Rockets,4,"a great date spot, with a killer charcuterie plate.  the owner is as friendly as can be."
Fresh City,5,"college bar right in allston which fills up quickly on nights and weekends.  the food is average pub food and is pretty cheap.  there is a full bar, pool and video games you can play by the bar.  they host trivia nights during the week."

Ba Lẹ Restaurant,5,the chicken and waffles here was hands down the nastiest looking dish ive ever received outside of a school cafeteria. honestly still tasted pretty good.
Life Alive Organic Cafe,4,"food was absolutely amazing.. drinks were okay,, but the lack of communication between the servers and the host ruined my overall experience. did reservations for a group of 7 and was told it was totally fine, upon arrival was told too many people which led to someone leaving, we explained it was a birthday and if we could have the birthday cake and the server gave us our checks instesd and we asked again if we could get the desert with the candle because we had asked for it when reservations were made and she gave us an attitude about how no one informed her. we had questions about the menu and waitress did not know the new menu which is not on the waitress fault but instead on management for not giving waiters more time or training on new menus. will probably just do take out from here and not dine in. the lack of communicationknowledge there is not worth the price, but again, food was absolutely amazing."
Halal Indian Cuisine,5,"annas across from mgh same great burritos as the rest of the locations in the boston area.  the set up of the restaurant is odd, but theres an ok seating area downstairs.  a very good option if youre around mgh."

Euno,4,"ive been a few times to this franchise. the first one was in 2013 in palo alto, bigger than this one, but all of these franchises share the same decoration, no matter the city or the building.first time i ordered a dish with salmon, i only remember it was yummy nothing else and for dessert a original cheesecake, a must if you come to this place.this last time there was a lane, so we needed to wait some minutes in order to hace dinner. after waiting, a member of the staff called us and took us to our table. i personally dont like how the service is managed, too exaggerated in my opinion, no need to give a speech or overact. despite of this, he attended us pretty good, firstly taking note of the beverages  the waiter exaggerating with every choice  and then the food. we sticked with burgers, after three weeks i hadnt had one, so it was time to order one.i order it medium cook, but for my opinion it was overcooked, nevertheless to say it was good and yummy. you can order your burger with french fries or one kind of vegetables  forget about ordering a mix of two or more .to wrap up the dinner we had godiva and dulce de leche cheesecakes, both very heavy but wonderful at the same time."
Chicked's Chicken & Grill,5,cheap but good food with lots of variety and efficient service.  i like the special deals each day and the calorie information next to each menu item.  also like the popcorn brought to your table when you arrive.

Cobblestone Café,4,"i found the food here average. the sushi was average at best, but the tamago egg was really bad. the texture of the tamago was off, and instead of being smooth it felt lumpy and rough. if i am not mistaken they have added in corn starch in it. the meal was also expensive for what i got. a californian roll and 3 slices of tamago cake up to 11 before tips."
Pavement Coffeehouse,5,burritos! tacos! and other stuff but when the burritos are that good why get anything else?
Black Seed Cafe & Grill,5,pricey good food i brought my family in one day three children and myself we all got waffles four of them two sides of sausage small juice for everybody for four people 60 then i waited 45 minutes before we ordered i wanted to leave. it was busy but not like that there was a party of 12 seated after us at 8 before we did way before. other times i have gone in there and had great experiences

Hulun Beir,3,"i should say i love this place somehow. its located on the second floor of a building, so dont judge the place when you see the stairs  its chinatown, some people usually spit on the floor  and head upstairs.ive never sat down and have lunch there, ive only been to this place to grab some food to go. the restaurant is big, with a lot of sitting inside and views to the street. the menu is big, and they lave a luncheon special composed by soup, dumplingsrolls and a main dish.when you enter you are asked for if you want to sit down or grab something to take away, and then they give the menu to you in order to take a look.the two times i sticked with the luncheon menu, so i grab a tom yum soup  hot and tasty  and some fried dumplings.i had pad thai with the mix of veggie alternative of shrimp and chicken, the taste of them were really good, i didnt miss the real shrimp or chicken.they packed everything in the bag really good, in order to avoid pouring something or accidentally open the recipients. however the recipients are pretty well built and their quality helps to avoid accidents.the second time  i had mango curry chicken, that was very good but i expected it to be more spicy.nonetheless to say, service is not as nice as outside chinatown  thats my experience when i ordered some food to go , but its very attendant and quick."
The Horse Allston,4,too fun
Earls Kitchen + Bar,5,"hands down one id the best italian places ive eaten at! seafooditalian menu will keep you salivating at the great choices available. like most boston area eateries,  its a smaller base with a connection to a full bar. youre food is cooked to perfection and the staff are friendly and on top of everything!"

Boloco 50 Congress,5,"i honestly cant say enough good things about this place. we were among the first seating on a balmy spring saturday evening in the north end. the staff was lovely. the wine was flowing and every course was a revelation. the lightest, airiest focaccia infused with a garden of rosemary. creamy, pillowy burrata with the sweetest pomodoro tomatoes. perfectly charred octopus with herbs and northern beans. no earthly idea how this dish remained so bright and fresh and didnt weigh me down. followed by an orange sorbet. its a mystery how the rounded, citrus depth of flavor was achieved and well, concentrated  for lack of a better word. its too good to be considered just a palate cleanser. oh...and the meatball. a fist of expertly blended beef, pork and veal. never heavy, it wades in a bath of san marzano marinara and is accompanied by a pot of whipped ricotta that we held on to after the course was over because it was too good not to finish. the contorno of roasted artichokes in a parmesan breadcrumb preparation with capers, fresh herbs and a lemon beurre blanc  just shut up! and then a braised short rib rigatoni in a tomato and red wine reduction. i really cant with how good this food is. dessert was zeppole  those wonderful little italian donuts. served warm, these bouncy balls of confection were accompanied by nutella and raspberry sauce. so much and all so good. there will be leftovers. i need another occasion quick in order to go again as last nights visit is taking its place on my list of fondest food memories."

Garlic 'n Lemons,4,expensive as compare to nyc and way less quantity and quality.
Texas Roadhouse,5,best halal food

Little Caesars Pizza,5,grrat spot
Boloco 50 Congress,5,"delicious cosy italian in a neighborhood of otherwise bland oversized barclubrestaurants. everything was creative and balanced with great flavors, although the menu is not large. focaccia with taleggio was especially great to start the meal. it was a little loud though, could use for some more soft materials or noise treatment."
Blaze Pizza,1,"considering its only a drive thru... i was very pleased with the quick service, and how they passed my ice tea to me in another cup so god forbid our hands touched.  im not trying to be flip, im not they are taking safety seriously and for that im grateful.im in the high risk column....so getting to go out and getting to see people, cars and the chance to enjoy a perfect iced tea was a pleasant surprise."

Typhoon Asian Bistro,3,beautiful view and delicious food
Cafe Polonia,5,gross pizza. not heated up completely.
Kelley Square Pub,4,"the marliave provides fine dining at a more affordable price than other places throughout boston. the food here is absolutely incredible, especially their escargot and brick chicken. their cocktail list is extensive, and as a history buff i love the nods to american history throughout. would highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion, getting drinks before going to the theater, or a date night."
Grainmaker,5,"we just decided not to stay and eat there. the place looked nice, menu was pretty atractive, and the environment seemed quite friendly. as soon as we walked in, though, things changed significantly. it took a while for someone to greet us at and get us a table, even though the place was pretty much empty. a woman waitresshostess? approached us with a really hostile attitude. she looked down in us and greeted us with a rudehumiliating look was she having a horrible evening and blaming it on us? was she just being blatantly prejudiced about who knows whatour skin color, our english accent, etc...?. her attitude was so unwelcoming and rude that we wondered how shes managed to keep her job thus far. we really hope she was just having a tough day. if thats the case, we wish her the best and hope no one else will get the attitude we got from her. unfortunately, there is absolutely no was we can recommend this place."
Dig,3,as good as it gets for outside covid dining. good food. no flies.would go back for outside dining.

Herrera's Mexican Grill,4,awesome restaurant!
1000 Degrees Pizza Salad Wings,4,"first of all, the fact that the place is so small and intimate makes it a great south end spot. i thought the food was inventive and delicious. tapas for italian isnt a concept i see often but this place made it work so well. my favorite thing we ordered were the meatballs they were the perfect size and had a tasty sauce. next time i want to try a pasta dish or pizza because many of them on the menu looked awesome."
Four Seasons Buffet,5,"pleasant place, good  but not great food and good service."
Tavern Road,5,"amazing atmosphere, this cash only italian throw back is a gem in this city.  excellent service.  food was amazing and service very good for a jammed packed restaurant.  would visit again."
Hopewell Bar & Kitchen,3,"terrible service. the manager also seems out of his league. other then the nice view out the window, this place was incredibly disappointing."
Granary Tavern,5,"its a bar. clean, sparse, big tvs, old school. probably used to smell like cigarettes. bartender was lovely, very friendly. we ordered lunch, no table service. my chicken caesar salad was enormous and perfectly fine. chicken was oddly teriyaki flavored. on street parking. nightmarishly tiny bathroom."
The Mission Bar & Grill,5,fresh and fast eats featuring roasted meats and veggie options prepared as wraps or plates. accessories like spicy whipped feta offer pops of flavor. save room for the greek yogurt its thick and rich like panna cotta.

Gourmet Dumpling House,5,great vovjy
Sbarro,5,"i was here last tuesday for first time with a friend. i let her do all the ordering and the food was great. my favorite dishes from the whole lunch menu was the udon. seasoned with soy sauce, sesame oil with mixed of vegetables and seafood like one shrimp and plenty slices  fish cake. the services was slow considering it was tuesday, 3pm afternoon. my friend having to ask for green tea not once but three times is a bit much. which is why i took one star away from this review. food is great and would come again to try it again."

China King,2,"this location of max brenner is not overly crowded wait time is around 20 minutes for a table for 2, 40 minutes for 4. the serving sizes and prices are equal to nearby competitor cheesecake factory and eataly for meal prices. the main attraction here is the chocolates and desserts, which may seem a pricey but expected for the quality you are paying for. service can get quite crowdedrushed and atmosphere gets very loud. i personally enjoyed the chocolates but many of my friends find them too much."
Granary Tavern,2,"im in boston, going to a new york deli and i ordered a chicago ruben. that ruben is hands down the best one i have had in ages.the deli has a small yet classic feel. if you dont feel like sitting in, the pedestrian area on washington street is one minute away.the deli gets busy but it really does not make much of a difference for your wait time. the employees are fast and they have a great paper bag system to get your order right and keep track of it.highly recommended"

Andiamo Restaurant + Bar,5,"cozy and delicious small italian restaurant right in the heart of the dessert hub. the menu does not have too much variety, although you can ask for several of the dishes to be made dairy free or vegan. the portions are normal to the smaller side, but are packed in flavor.normally it is difficult to get a table to eat here, so its best to order a reservation or waltz in with a stroke of luck. although the wait staff is accommodating, they are not that attentive nor hospitable enough for a restaurant environment."

Five Guys,4,ordered this off of the postmates app for delivery. it was very good. i got a grande shrimp burrito and it was a lot of food and very well done and tasty. the only issue i had which is why im not giving 5 stars is that i requested certain things off of my burrito but it still came with it. i would suggest adding special instructions with the order if you get it on postmates. the delivery was also very fast and still hot. well wrapped and a decent size. overall will order again!!

The Playwright Bar,4,coffee and donuts and breakfast who dont want that good people

Dimitrio's House of Pizza,5,"the speed of delivery is incredible, even for a dim sum joint, but unfortunately the cart selections are just ok. with the exception of the har gow, the shu mai and the dumplings were too sweet for our taste. and they dont serve turnip cake! the rice cakes were very good for dessert."

Stephi's on Tremont,4,"heavy handed battening, worth the few extra  on the drinks."
Wingstop,5,"breakfast was delicious. the only thing that was kind of off putting was when we 1st came in we were sat right in front of the bathroom door in the corner in a little tiny table with 10 other people pretty much elbow to elbow.. we had to move it was a little crowded but it is a diner after all.  we really couldnt eat as people went in and out of the door, kinda gross. so we moved to the counter seats. my friend was here from n. carolina and i wanted him to have a great boston experience. i grew up in boston so i know its pricey especially in downtown. but i wasnt expecting to pay 45 for french toast and a veggie omlet it was definitely delicious but not really worth 45 plus tip..."

Taiwan Cafe,4,"i wish i could write a different review, but here goes my experience.on saturday we had a reservation for 4 people.when we arrived, few minutes after being seated, the waitress informed us that they run out of pizza. since we went there only for that, we decided to leave the venue. ten minutes later, as we were waiting for a taxi to go to a different restaurant, the waitress came out to tell us that in 30 min they would have been able again to offer us pizza.we left because the taxi was already on its way, but that night they showed a poor managing a place that is famous for the pizza should not run out of it by 8pm on saturday, knowing that they still have more customers coming."

"Happy Lamb Hot Pot, Boston 快乐小羊",4,great food consistently! good options as well.
Atlantic Fish Co,4,the reason for the three stars is as follows  i placed my order for a rootbeer float with chocolate ice cream and got a look from the woman behind the counter.  the look persisted and then she told me that she had never made one of these before.  who cares what kind of ice cream i want in my rootbeer float.
Bistro du Midi,1,very good every week im there if you go one time you will go every time...

Clerys,4,always a hit!!!!!
Garbanzo Mediterranean Fresh,5,what a wonderful restaurant! we started going here about 5 years ago and every time we go it is a wonderful experience. the food is always magnificent and the service is top notch. it is refreshing to go to a restaurant that you dont seem out of place when you are properly dressed for an evening out. when the majority of places have turned into casual attire and offer casual fare and service to find a place the is truly exceptional is a rarity. its all the little personal touches they add to the experience and the pride they put into offering superior food and service that make grill 23 a restaurant you want to go to all the time.

Little River Inn,5,"if you want to enjoy french starters, they have the foie gras. if you want to enjoy french desserts, they have the tarte tatin, sabl breton or crme brle. if you want the french atmosphere, they set up tables outside during spring and summer. all this without leaving boston"
Darryl's Corner Bar & Kitchen,5,great food and great veiw.  very courteous service.
Boloco,5,"you pay in advance and they buzz you as soon as your food its ready.  well thats the idea.  so why are the fries served cold and hard?  at 630, when they should be in the middle of rush hour?  i could possibly understand if they had a hundred items on the menu and a waiterwaitress was overwhelmed with food deliveries.  but when you basically only sell burgers and fries and you cant even manage to get the fries right?  its not right.  its unforgivable.  i guess its smart that they make you pay before they serve you the cold food.better yet, dont bother with the rocket."
Starbucks,5,"i love applebees. but unfortunately, i didnt like this one boston road, springfield ma. the glasses were dirty, i had to ask for the drinks after eating the appetizers, had to ask for napkins. but, even worse,  my husbands food looked like it was taken from another plate. it was a chicken alfredo pasta and had cheddar cheese under the chicken, and crumbs. the pasta was cold and dry. he asked for jalapeos,  and they even had black seeds inside. very poor service.  my mashed potatoes were watery.  i had to throw away my food. never again.  i rather go to hadley, 20 minutes away."

Paani,5,one of the best indian places in boston. get the chicken korma.
Shake Shack,5,burritos come in two different sizes. there are also two ordering windows when it gets too busy. the food here is clean and flavourful. its unlike chipotle that it tastes fresh and without the weighted oilsgrease. the horchata here is also very good and refreshing.  lots of seating here.
Scali Cafe,4,"went here before a show on lansdowne.  pretty happening place and a colorful crowd, otherwise a typical pub style restaurant. one person in my party ordered beef brisket because the menu explained they smoke their own bbq, but found it atypical compared to a traditional texas cut brisket and not very satisfying, also comparatively expensive. maybe the pulled pork is better.  i heard better things from those who had a burger or the nachos.  another in my party had the fish tacos and said they were better than average. they served beer pitchers, which i liked.  would have given 4 stars if it wasnt for the brisket letdown."
Deuxave,5,food was good. fresh and hot.

Supreme House of Pizza,5,nope just nope
Los Arrieros,1,wow! what a great find. ill be back soon!
Minerva Indian Cuisine,5,the staff was great very friendly and attentive i just felt the bread was kind of mushy and breaking apart crumbling. i have been waiting a while to get these rotis because ive heard so much about them and the restaurant isnt open everyday. theyre good but i like mumsys better. again staff fantastic!
The Oceanaire Seafood Room,5,"had high hopes for this one, the menu sounded good.  just didnt live up to my hope.started with their kim chee calamari.  i enjoy kim chee but i saw no evidence of it in this dish.  calamari was beautifully presented but kinda heavy on the fried batter coating.  overall, dish was bland.for my entree i ordered the coconut shrimp and crab cake with skinny fries and more.  crab cake was a mushy pile of crab that had been slightly crisped on the flat top, drizzled with a citrus  chili sauce. i could taste neither of those two ingredients... crab cake really could have used that, the sweetness of the crab was only sweetened further by the sauce.  too much so.  coconut shrimp, very overcooked.i there would be any reason to come back here for me.  3 stars for ambiance and server."
Spagnuolo's Restaurant,1,"this place is always packed but the food alone is worth the visit. staffs were not the kindest people but we definitely enjoyed our lobster roll and fish taco, and the view of the harbor was just lovely."
Yamato Hibachi & Sushi Bar,5,good spicy food
Crazy Good Kitchen (C.G.K ON NEWBURY),4,arguably best burger open late.
Strega Italiano Seaport,3,"for being at an airport, i think the service is a bit slow, albeit the staff was very friendly and nice. they know people are trying to board flights, and they want to grab a quick bite to eat and go.i ordered the caprese salad, and the croutons were definitely past their prime, the tomatoes looked like they had been sliced yesterday kinda dried out, definitely not fresh, the lettuce was pretty good, but not my favorite in terms of taste. now i will say that the mozzarella was actually very fresh, and the lobster salad i added 10 extra was excellent.seating was very good, but they really should have more space for luggage as theyre not set up for that, and again this is an airport."
China Sea Restaurant,5,good greek food
Santarpio's Pizza,5,"excellent honey brew, but food is way too expensive"
Compari's Banquet Facility,3,"the ramen was not as good as santouku down the street, but just as expensive. it wasnt bad. i would return to try other things"

Coach Grill,5,"not quite the hype i heardtoo many new places competing for the place to be seen. i was there for a social group meeting and we were squished into a corner despite 40 people showing up. if youre going to host groups, get a friggin space for them.my husband and i actually went for dinner shortly after they opened. being an older couple they stuck us away from the trendy people they want to cater too, and the service sucked. the food was cold and the wait staff was all over the cool patrons, not us. i would never recommend this place to anyone i know."
Paradise Biryani Pointe,4,"great food, nice atmosphere.  hand made dishes were plated nicely. delicious."
Coda,4,"absolutely fantastic dim sum. great quality and variety for a great price. as a 21 yo college boy i can eat my fill without breaking the bank. would definitely recommend going with someone who knows the food. you  pick what you as it comes by, its not always clear whats inside and not everyone speaks great english. also, check the dim sum hours. regular lunchdinner are good, but not on the same level."

Mirchi Nation-Indian Kitchen,5,ive been to olive gardens on and off although this one does not stand out in any way i will say that most times and ive gone to this olive garden theres usually a wait which does not necessarily mean that the food is good it just means that people are going out and this is one of the better places that used to eat i do appreciate the fact that on occasion they do offer samples of wine to people who are waiting and the unlimited breadsticks are a hit for the grandkids

Boston Pizza & Grill,4,"stopped here with my girlfriend for dessert and they sat us right away.  this was during the fall season it was somewhat busy.  the decor was clean and modern straight lines open space kind of place.  you can practically see all around the place.  we had the bread pudding and it was pretty good.  we make it a point to have bread pudding where ever we can and this one was a 6 out of 10.  so better than most.  the food and atmosphere seems to be a blend of japanese and modern.  so seems to be the food, a blend of japanese food and some other cultures  not really sure.  food looks pretty good though and everyone seems to be enjoying themselves.  this seems like a good place to go and relax, chat with others, and reasonably priced food.  they staff seemed really nice too."

The Harp,4,food is so delicious and prices are very reasonable

Winsor Dim Sum Café,2,"expensive, but you get what you pay for.  mixed drinks were great and they were apologetic that they had sold out of maine beer lunch when i tried to order it.  they suggested something i hadnt tried before and it was a worthy replacement.only had a few apps but they were tasty.  place was pretty empty though on a thursday after work. started to fill up with the dinner crowd around 7."

Salvatore's,5,"great place, had a lot of fun bowling. the wings were great and the fries quite tasty. but the pizza was a bit of a let down."
Salvatore's,4,"my southie heart loves lincoln with its well sized space and dark booths with 2 full sized bars. as a more upscale location on the busy broadway street, lincoln boasts good food and specialty cocktails to bring nonsouthie patrons over the west 4th bridge. being one of the few locations open til 2am in southie, occasionally brings a line to get in after 9pm on the weekends. the wood fire pizzas are served late and your will not be disappointed with the butternut squash. the back room tends to be less crowded for those who dont like to be elbow to elbow but if you are looking for young single professionals, this is your spot."
Kaze Shabu Shabu,2,"great food and excellent scenery must try the baked fish, whole clams and onion rings. they have a good cup of coffee flat top fried burgers and dogs.  ice cream and shakes salads too."

Sudbury Pizza Place,5,love hate relationship with mcdonalds. ice cream machine is always broken. 
Champions,5,"i am a boston foodie!!! i travel all around massachusetts looking for great food and bipoc safe restaurants and this restaurant gets my approval. it is not black owned but the staff are poc and the chef is phenomenal! if i remember correctly he is from louisiana and you can taste it in the cooking. i am from boston but my family and tribes are spread all over the south. my fav is nc and new orleans, this food is the closest you will ever get to that nola taste in boston."
Rome Pizza & Grill,5,"had been a frequent patron in years past. sad to say, this place has gone down hill.small portion in relation to price tag would be understandable for boston downtown location, but the portion still seems smaller than what we used to get  the large pho really is medium if even measuring by the amount of noodle in the bowl.they appeared busy even when only 60 of the place was filled. we were a group of five were seated after a few minutes of waiting despite several empty tables in sight, because no one came to the front to seat us.we ordered couple shakes with an appetizer along with our ricenoodle dishes. waited a bit for our food to come sporadically not together. one of our dish orders was wrong but quickly corrected another got a duplicate. small glitches with service at bare minimum.food quality on most dishes was ok. shakes are on point. the grilled meatmix vermicelli looked good. my pork chop pho did not appear to have the same kind of grilled pork chop one would see on the rice dish  the meat has flavor, but its white and thick instead of brown and thinner as it would be on the rice, and its submerged in my hot soup. the other dish that came out wrong the first time, the beef was said to be too chewy.two things worth noting 1 the tile flooring seemed stickygreasy to a point it was slippery, so tread carefully. 2 ladies room toilet transforms into old ye faithful upon flushing no joke!, so get your nice clothes and shoes wayyy out of the way to avoid getting splashed. the stall is tight too.for old times sake, they get a 3star, though i am beginning to wonder why still the long lines. with all the new things popping out in the area and a much better pho place we have found off boston where we frequent, there really is not an urgent need to return."

Nud Pob Thai Cuisine,4,quick table turnover and moderately priced.
Chung King Rick's Cafe,5,i went for dinner last night and the meal was excellent! try the twin catch for only 9.99. it consists of baked schrod and shrimp with a crumb topping and a choice of side. i got rice and both were cooked perfectly. my friend had the sirloin tips and said they were delicious. the apple streusel for dessert was just enough to end the meal in a great way. staff are super and service was also excellent. the 99 has put safe distancing regulations in place for a very comfortable dining experience.
Venezia Restaurant Boston,2,"great atmosphere ,,,,service is slow ,,,,food is overpriced,,,enjoyed the fried salmon appetizer"
D'Parma Italian Cuisine,4,the spanish speaking staff was friendly we dialoguesd with the little spanish i know and they were responsive and receptive. the place was clean and they looked like they were gearing up for an evening rush. i am giving 4 stars because ive never eatened their food i was just there picking up for delivery.  i spoke to one guy who said their food was good and it looked good. so its on my list now.
Pauli's,5,"mediocre as it goes.  service is outstanding and everyone is incredibly friendly and prompt.  99s food quality has dropped a ton and other than the buffalo wings and beer im not sure there is anything worth ordering.  this applies to all locations, not the chefs fault ."

Centre Street Cafe,5,"food is really good. its tapas small plates, so you have to know what youre in for. my favorite is the pork belly and the chicken pimientos one of the best chickens ive ever had, but i warn you that its spicy. the only knock on the place is that twice weve gone with a reservation for a large group, arrived on time both times, and still ended up waiting about 1 hour each time. if you are ok hanging out at the bar for the wait, the place is worth it."
Harborside Grill and Patio,1,"food and attention are always excellent.  ill never change this restaurant as long they continue offering marvelous attention by the host and wonderful food. i love the new look. everytime i go i see something new. i like the natural,  great entrance...impressive. the best of all everyone is welcome. please dont change."

Bin 26 Enoteca,4,excellent traditional food. may have to wait at lunch time. i always get the 50 but my friends get pho with extra meat.
Meritage Restaurant,5,"we just came here for the hot chocolate, it was okay. the server was nice, but not very attentive we sat at the bar and it was totally empty. it came in the famous hug mug, which id never tried before. i have to say, i totally disagree with the design of this. the hot chocolate was piping hot, the whole idea of the mug is that you cup it with two hands so youre hugging it when sipping it. since the beverage is so warm, the cup was actually way too warm to hold until the drink was lukewarm. i really dont understand the design concept here? the waiter had to give me a napkin to be able to drink the hot chocolate. a little overpriced for hot chocolate, to be completely honest.i went to the gift shop afterwards and waited forever and a half while the associate helped someone else out theres only one working for the store. after she had finished helping out the other customer, she failed to come over and ask me if i needed assistance i knew exactly what i wanted, i just couldnt reach it. i had to go over to the cash wrap to ask her for help. the only place to get this cup was way above my head height, and the woman wasnt sure if she had a latter.... what was supposed to be the plan, here?still, this place has quite an extensive dessert menu if youve got a sweet tooth and need to get your fix."
Friendly's,5,fun experience. average food
Sweet Cheeks Q,5,i was disappointed in dimitrios.  we just went for a large cheese pizza how do you mess this up? well the pizza was very dry. i was so disappointed.  but the flavor was good and i really feel like this may have been a fluke. so i havent given up on them and am looking forward to try my next large cheese pizza from dimitrios.  i will ask them not to overcook it. once they master my pizza im sure i will venture onto other menu items.

James Hook & Co,1,went for valentines day. granted it was expected to be a rush but they gave us a wait time of 40 minutes and we didnt get seated until 1 hour 30 minutes. we couldnt even go to another place cause wed committed so much time to waiting there. please just be honest with ure time waits that is all. my gf called at 2 pm and they told her she can just walk in any time of that  night and get a table which was also not true. we could have avoided this by just telling her on the phone there will be a longer wait time and wed try to eat earlier since we were on a schedule.

Summer Shack,1,your service is great and the food its so good so keep up the good work..
Boston Pizza Company,3,"i am really starting to love southie. there i said it. the restaurants ive been to are all above excellent including this one. my friend and i sat outside, ate hummus topped with freshly chopped scallions and bread while we meandered through the menu.annette ordered the tuna tartare and i ordered a wonderful toasted orzo and argula salad with oranges, almonds and a honey soy  dressing. waiter was very friendly, but a bit pushy."
Venezia Restaurant Boston,5,"even though it is a chain, it is worth the visit for their addictive fried chicken. a little pricey, but the chicken is so crispy yet juicy inside that it is worth it. while the chicken is the star, dont overlook their other menu items as they serve some really solid korean food. it is usually crowded so plan on waiting a little bit."
Tavern Road,5,"i was pleasantly surprised by giacomos. all of my friends and coworkers hyped this place up so much that it took me a few years to muster up some semblance of motivation to try it out, and wow am i glad that i did!my date ordered the frutti di mare pasta and i ordered the lobster ravioli. we also ordered a calamari to share.the calamari itself was by far the best i have ever had because it was fried to light, crispety, crunchety perfection. the marinara sauce was also light, not too salty, and actually enhanced the flavor of the calamari instead of masking it like so many other places.i snuck a bite of the frutti di mare and it was very flavorful, but holy cow, the lobster ravioli was perfect. it was a bit al dente but the added texture made the dish more interesting. the sauces were incredible all around and im already planning my next date night at giacomos!"
Herrera's Mexican Grill,5,good filet and lobster
Bonne Chance Cafe,4,"the fries were great! cane with two infants, a toddler, and a 10 year old. plenty of room and friendly staff to help make it a good experience."
Chutneys Boston,4,"disappointed with legal. we had two appetizers and split an entree for lunch. calamari was cool and greasy. clam chowder was good. crabcake entree was also cool and greasy, and looked like it had been moved around the plate. i suspect that the food sat under a warming lamp for a while. adding insult to the mediocre food, they charged us 8 to split the crabcake entree.i used to believe that you could not go wrong with legal seafood, but now know better."

RUKA,1,"the food took a little longer to be ready which i understand, however when i picked up my food and brought it home, i  realized i received the wrong food. i ordered and paid for a spicy beef dish, and they gave me some bland chicken. when i called to ask why they screwed me over, the owner first told me to drive back to the restaurant to get the right dish. like i should be the one to make the drive. then instead of offering to send a delivery guy with the right order, i could get a free egg roll on my next visit.  really? so i have to spend more money there for them to make up for their mistake. yeah right. ill check out other places. what a jerk. wish i hadnt tipped."

RUKA,2,wonderful people working here.
Jimmy John's,4,"you should consider yvonnes if atmosphere and ambiance are the most important things in a bar for you. this place is no joke when it comes to decor, design, art, and vibe. i mean, i was shown through a secret bookshelf doorway to get to the downstairs bar, and the whole place has a chill and interesting vibe that will appeal to people in their 20s and people in their 60s. its not loud and rowdy like a brewery.their cocktail drinks are also a bit on the strong side, which i think is refreshing. they have interesting flavors, which admiteddly i didnt care for, but my friend did. for reference, im a gin guy and my friend is a white wine girl.one of the downsides are that the prices are on the higher end of the scale. the teapot cocktail is 50, though it is for 2 people. if you are small, then a single half teapot will likely be enough. the cocktails were in the range of 17 eachanother downside, which is related to price, are the portions of food. two oysters were 10, five meatballs that were clearly from a package with some soy sauce on top were 15. they do have feast options, if you are willing to spend 100.still, yvonnes is not a restaurant so these are forgivable.its really easy to get to by public transit. its right in downtown crossing. if you plan to drive, which is not recommended for several reasons, i doubt you will find parking.im definitely coming back to yvonnes. if you like a unique, lively but not loud atmosphere with your drinks, its hard to do better."
Pastoral ARTisan Pizza + Kitchen + Bar,5,great food and warm environment
Dunkin',3,"great restaurant! service was phenomenal and the food was very delicious. pricey, but they have great cocktails! get the ones with dry ice for the coolest experience. i loved their lemon drop and their cosmo! the view is amazing and very pretty at sunset. would definitely recommend and i hope to return soon."

Sweet Life,4,"i was fortunate to experience a wonderful dining out experience at boston chops during dine out boston restaurant week. we went with a resrevation of 4 on a friday night and were seated promptly without need to grab a drink at the classic bar setup, even though the place was packed. the meal was preselected from the dine out menu 1 appetizer 3 choices, 1 entree  3 choices, 1 dessert etc  i got the oysters on the half shell, steak and frites, and creme brulee. the meal was timely and delicious, the fries in my opinion was the best even though the steak was properly cooked mediumrare with 3 sauces to choose from and they allowed me to try all 3. the red wine was flowing and the meal was a success with friends. recommended for date nights, but expect steakhouse prices."

Coco Leaf,5,"it is a noisy but trendy college kinda place. not very fancy, but well suited to a young no frills crowd. dont expect high end ramen, never thought id be saying those words when i was in college myself but it is decent and not too pricy. the place is in a back corner of a food court, but is its own place. it tends to be breezy because the doors are always open and there is no vestibule, so in tge winter it is chilly."
The Living Room,5,oh. my. gawd!  i dont know why i havent reviewed this before.  haymarket pizza has been around forever and the pizza is delicious and so affordable!  always the perfect new york style thin crispy crust that a pizza should be and the flavors are fresh and change daily.

Kaze Shabu Shabu,4,the lobster ravioli was some of the best ive ever had but the crab cakes were surprisingly disappointing for such an acclaimed place and being in boston where crab cakes are generally very good. service was good especially considering how packed it was! definitely will come back eventually the savor that garlic cream lobster ravioli!!

Coppa Enoteca,5,elegant and welcoming.   great food!
Cafe Porto Bello,5,the servent for distributing seats is rude and non responsive
Casa Romero,4,"saw the boston music awards for the first time in years. the sound was terrible, partly because of the booming rooms acoustics and partly because of poor mix choices. the subs and lows were way over emphasized. maybe quadruple as loud as needed. snare drum was nearly inaudible for some acts, vocals were completely unintelligible even when there wasnt background music. part of this was poor mic technique on the part of the artists, cupping the mic, and rapping at tempos that only work in a studio setting. many of the singers were way out of tune, starting on the wrong note and then not correcting. i am assuming that they couldnt hear themselves but its possible that they werent good singers in the first place. the entire midrange of the music was absent. guitars, bass and keys were really hard to hear through the mud. it was really disappointing both artistically and from an audio reinforcement perspective. the lasers were fun at least."
Lolita Back Bay,5,"delicious, greasy korean fusion. crazy yummy. everything here is good. fried rice. tacos. chicken poppers. quesadilla. if you go during a normal meal time, though, dont expect to find a table there are only 3 tables plus a counter."

Little Steve's Pizzeria,4,"i really like this place!staff is very friendly, food is good. prices are ok for newbury street."
C Fruit Life,5,food and specialty drink no. if you go it be to listen to the band which i was on my way out so didnt get to hear. the ladies was great attending to your every needs but no go again. they were very accommodating and removed my meal. i will not go in to detail why i was deterred. but would go again
Legal C Bar,5,"amazing place. you are not quite sure how to classify it, it is a store, a restaurant, a bar? i think it is allinone. from a fancy dinner to a casual sandwich, you can find it all in eataly. the food is delicious and it has atmospheres for all kinds of dining, be it calmly restaurantesque, to a relaxing sub while standing. they have a great selection of mainly italian products which you can purchase."

Thai Basil,4,"so much fun for a night out with coworkers or friends! they serve alchohol on the expensive side although if you are up for a fun bowling night out, this is a cool place to try!"
The Daily Catch Waterfront,4,"this restaurant is worth the visit, but you might want to bring earplugs. you might get lucky, but no need to suffer if you have first year students rich parents, please dont indulge your poorly endowed offspring you cant pay for them to get talent for the entertainment andor the sound tech. the place seems to be staffed entirely by berklee students maybe the chef is a pro.there used to be this notion of the struggling artist, sorry if my age is showing, but that has been eliminated by projects such as this oncampus eatery.why three stars? probably a solid two, but the waitress was attentive and very friendly. the appetizers were tasty fried brussels spouts, grilled prawns, and some excellent mushrooms. my burger and fries were good friends ribs were kinda dry baked sea bass was nice. its just that the sound was disappointing i mean annoying, but that sounds kinda petty, though not the fault of the student performers. this is a music school, shouldnt the sound be awesome?"
Kantin,4,"tasty and valuetasty burger is in that category of  burger places that is a couple steps above your average fast food, but still a step below a sit down restaurant.among them, it stands out as giving a quality product at a reasonable price, with a good sized meal."

Palate Restaurant Latin Inspired Cuisine & Bar,5,"go to globe for their sangria. just trust me on this one, go for the red variety. they have a large downstairs bar with plenty of seating for large groups and a pretty sweet roof deck  that is just off of boylston street  that makes you feel like you are tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the city. this is a great place for a casual after work drink or a spot on your next bar crawl in back bay."
Fresh City,5,pretty good but the restroom need to be fixed
Lunch Box Deli,5,cute place. our bartender was okay. friendly enough. not a huge drink selectionvariety. dont try the kimchi back shot. fair warning lol

Assaggio,1,new covid hourswen sat   8am 4pmabsolutely love this place. i consider it the 1 haitian bakery in that area food is amazing and the customer service is pleasant. im sure many others agree with me. only gave it 4 stars as sometimes they have long line that honestly can be solved by having more than just 1 person tending to the customers.
Wink & Nod,5,"average lunch, high prices,"
Toasted Flats,5,translated by google opinions are divided and understandable. the decor is pretty messy and the concept of you pay for me to beg you and keep repeating the same things over and over is not always appreciated. the waitresses are a nice time and a mean time. i think you understand the idea. otherwise the cheese burgers and beers are good! its up to you if you want to try the experience!originalles avis sont partags et c comprhensible. le decor est assez brouillon et le concept de tu payes pour que je tenguelle et te rabche sans cesse les mmes choses nest pas toujours apprci. les serveuses sont un temps gentilles et un temps mchantes. je pense que vous comprenez lide. sinon les cheese burgers et les bires sont bons! a vous de voir si vous voulez tenter lexprience!

Mediterranean Grill,5,"best neighborhood chinese restaurant for a recent chinese immigrant who are not from the cantonese culture. american chinese food is good enough for non chinese but too boring for new chinese immigrants. shuns kitchen is determined to bring authentic chinese food to the table mixed with great traditional favorite. the owner shawn and his crew are awesome. so blessed they are close to me. my favorite is still being discovered since they keep on updating their menu. but if you are confident about taking bones out of fish, try the whole fish. the pork belly is my all time favorite. its almost as good as my moms cooking."

Bristol Restaurant and Bar,3,translated by google the style of the shop is high feeling. i wish i had to go for a risotto or a fish line.original
anoush'ella,5,this place serves some tasty tapas style small plates and a great variety of cocktailsmixed drinks! the service was friendly and the atmosphere inside was much more exotic and stylish than the relatively plain exterior would suggest. the food is just a bit expensive for both the quality and quantity that is served but the menu they offer is quite unique so definitely still worth a try!

Granary Tavern,5,"while still having some of the best chowder in town, this place is resting on its laurels. no longer the best. variety is getting less and noise level is getting more."
Pavement Coffeehouse,4,bartender was absolutely amazing at the downstairs bar. my friend and i both have dietary restrictions and between the two of us we should probably not ever try to go out to eat... but he helped us make accommodations and find something delicious! i had the rice bowl with tofu and she got the brick chicken with polenta. both were really good! whispering angel rose was a good pair for both. this was good redemption from my terrible experience at their dedham location. i trust again and will certainly go back to this met bar!the croque monsieur is probably the best sandwich ive ever had in my life.
T Anthony's Pizzeria,4,trendy hip underground location that you could potentially miss from the street view. dark lightening brings a fantastic entertaining twist to a mexican restaurant. you start with dry ice tequila iceys to cleanse the palate and then indulge in flavorful unique dishes. finally end with a special twist with a complimentary desert that brings you a carnival feel. do not miss out on this gem

Union Bar and Grille,5,"visited today after a long time.  this place has gone way down in quality, a disgrace actually.  spinach tasted like paste or some chemical, not like spinach.  quantity was small, chicken was extra greasy and small.  water, 16 oz, 2.29!  they dont  care anymore and it is evident.  girl was rude too and walked away without giving me my receipt,  had to lean way  over counter to the other side to retrieve it.  place needs to close.  i wont go back.  maybe if they fire the manager, which they should do swiftly.  also owner should sell to a more competent owner and promise to never go into the restaurant  business again."

Bon Me,5,i never really enjoyed a meal from cheesecake factory. poorly prepared food ive going there several times at different locations and ive never really fully enjoyed myself. the best thing to get is there overly price cheesecake. i wonder if theyd been brought out by some other company because they seem to be going down hill. they used to have a nice variety of cheesecakes there such as the apple strudel snicker and other flavor. they not consistent on anything
Clerys,5,the best pizza around...
The Elephant Walk South End,4,good food. portions were small for the price. fish overcooked
Tony's Pizza and Restaurant,3,"ok here goes. we ended up here because there was no line while roamig the area in the boston north endthere is a reason there was no line.we were seated and given water quickly and after about 10 minutes ordered. about 10 minutes later we were offered bread and again offered more bread after 30 minutes. our waitress said they were really busy and thats why our food wasnt here yet. 3 tables around us had come in, eaten and left and our order was still not up. 1 hour and 37 minutes after we sat the food was served. 2 shrimp scampi, carbonara, chicken with pasta for the wife and chicken parmesan for me. the pasta on the chicken parmesan and chicken with pasta was served in its own bowl not together...not to bad. the carbonara was as my daughter is described was not good and she ate 1 bite. my son got shrimp scampi and in his 1st bite was treated to a nice big hair. the other scampi was really watery and he fought down 2 bites then left it at that. i ate about half and my chicken parmesan was 2 pieces, half was cooked decent and the other was rubber. fortunately the rubber was the 2nd piece so at least i got half the meal. the wife said her meal was edible not good but not bad...just ok.so after being there for 2 hours, 3 of the 5 meals were not eaten, one was sent back and nothing else was ordered...hair in your food is kind of an appetite killer. the other scampi and carbonara and my half chicken parmesan were tossed in a single container and brought home to feed the chickens. we saw the waitress in our 2 hours 4 times, twice at the beginning and twice at the end. she was absent for almost an hour and a half in the middle. the owner i think came out and asked how the meal was totally unaware of the meal sent back. he explained that he would never go out to eat on a weekend as everything is worse. i said thats a really poor excuse for the quality of food we got and then my wife said it wasnt worth it so that was that.  the hairy scampi was removed from the bill and we were apologized to again and again reminded to not go out to eat on the weekend? so for a mere 90.00 plus tip we were served 5 meals of which 4 and a half were not edible and told not to go out and eat on the weekends.also as we learned after eating there gordon ramsey featured this restaurant on kitchen nightmares.......hey gordon you need to go back."

The Glenville Stops,2,great place for socializing with a group! i love appy hour!!
Legal Test Kitchen,5,solid venue. the atmosphere is pretty chill for a bigger place and there is a decent amount of standing room as well as balcony room. drinks are no more expensive than most restaurants in the area and the foundation room offers a great place to relax before and after the show. i dont think 20 dollars is really worth some couches and private bathrooms but it is very relaxing and quiet. cool spot and as long as there isnt a red sox game parking is 10 bucks for six hours at most parking lots around fenway.
Ruth's Chris Steak House,5,"just wow! the service, drinks food everything excellent."
El Centro Mexican Restaurant,5,"i remember when trade first opened. i worked at the financial district at the time, and people always welcome a new place as good barsrestaurants that are close to the area are few and far between. when planning team events, we always end up at the same places as it is important not to stray too far from the office if you want people to come you know, they want to spend time with their families and stuff . trade instantly became the place to go, so it could get very crowded and loud. the drinks area bit pricey, but no more than any other place in the area. the menu can tend to be a little all over the place, so somethings are a hit and some are a miss. i usually went with coworkers or a group of friends, so my recommendation is to order several flatbreads for the group to share. they are unique and always tasty. i also love their arugula salad  its a simple salad arugula, parsley, mint, lemon and parmesan, but is perfect as a starter for the meal."
Legal C Bar,5,decent food. ok prices.

Fire Dough Kitchen,5,"the food here is spectacular and the staff was friendly and accommodating. our food was prepared and delivered quickly, and everything tasted great. my only negative comment is that this place feels very claustrophobic. youre almost touching every person sitting near you, and theres only space for one person to walk each walkway. otherwise great place"

La Casa Del Pandebono,5,"went to the new quincy location for family brunch. food was good but very limited menu and the prices were high. the service was horrible, it didnt seem that servers could handle a large party. also the bussers were fairly rude, could not effectively communicate, and they left dirty traysnapkins on clean tables. if a zero star option was possible this place earned it. when we went to leave, i didnt see a table with a smiling face."

Restaurante Montecristo,5,"best location, so good"

Boston Seafood,5,the food was only mediocre and not worth the incredible loan wait. will was great very friendly me and my date to right at home but i must say i am overall disappointed in the experience..i suppose that if you really want to go to italian food you must spring for the cab fare and the go to the north end
Noon Mediterranean,5,"simply food, looks like a fast food.fish and chips correct, not famous.same for sunday and ice cream.but it will be mandatory for you to consider it if you are angry or thirsty, because it is the only food options kilometers around !as it is the only option... prepare to wait with others customers particularly during lunch time."

Sushi Station,5,"first, i choose this restaurant because of the raving reviews of their attention to detail for people who are gluten free or have celiac disease. i personally have celiac disease, so finding an italian restaurant that is authentic and understanding of cross contamination is super important to me.i had the gluten free pasta and gluten free garlic bread. the garlic bread was not what you would imagine it was more like a dense flat bread. it was worth the purchase though. i had the pasta dish at the top of the house specials page with veal, shrimp, and chicken in a garlic wine sauce. i thought it was rather tasteless and the gluten free pene was nothing better than i couldve bought from any grocery store. pretty disappointing for close to 30. maybe its because we came 30 minutes before the kitchen closed? but i felt that we were early enough to not be that customer.al dente is my girlfriend and her familys favorite italian restaurant. i had only been here once before about  year ago. i would try it again, but more because its safe place i can find sustainance for myself and that it has awesome food for people without celiac disease. i wouldnt return simply to enjoy their food on my own though.celiac friendly? yes. delicious? meh. go cook your own udis pasta and save 30."
Fajitas & 'Ritas,4,"probably one of the best pizzas in town!the staff are friendly but very busy so dont expect them to wait on you all the time.lamb and beef are good, but theyre not marinated or anything, but they are grilled over charcoal so it adds a good flavour.i would stick to pizza cause its amazing!"

Union Oyster House,5,"was hoping for a nice christmas eve dinner with the family, and while the view was indeed nice, the fixed price dinner was very disappointing. we all ordered something different, and unfortunately every single thing tasted like they had cut corners and threw way too many flavours on the plate. as a family of well practiced home cooks, the sauces, meats, sides, and most especially the desserts, were all well below the level of what we would have wanted to serve at our own table. maybe the regular dinner menu is better. this one wasnt worth the price."
Trophy Room,5,great place for a romantic dinner on the harbor. fantastic service and food!
New Jumbo Seafood Restaurant,5,"i have worked with restaurant owners in my career, b2b, and personally worked at two restaurants. only a very small handful are truly deserving of the five star rating. this one is it.we ordered sushi, chicken buns and pork  beef buns. all were delicious. perfect. superb quality meats  ingredients. absolutely no stems seeds bone fragments or any little yorkies. plus it was all prepared very fast. looking forward to returning for their other dishes!"
Mangia Mangia Italian Kitchen,5,"indian food is difficult to get right, and this place would agree. the meat is somehow chewy and the pieces small. the curries are bland and missing the bang you get at a good indian place. the naan is dry and chewy, with crispy bits missing. if youre in the area, and craving asian food, maybe try one of the nearby pho places instead. if you do go, it may only be worth it for a lunch deal."
Mumbai Spice,2,very nice place but way too expensive for me.

Cafe Podima,4,small place  long waits on certain days. food doesnt leave you feeling greasy and disgusting like other dim sum places.
"Explorateur Cafe, Restaurant & Bar",4,"my go to sushi spot in boston. the salmon on fire is one of my favoritesedit the last two times i went the food was extremely sub par. the service was just as poor. my girlfriend took me for my birthday tonight. i felt rushed, they didnt ask to get me another beer until i asked for the check.  the salmon on fire was an inch thick,  chewy, and just unpleasant to eat. i sent three out of four rolls back tonight. the chef came up to our table to ask if i had ordered the correct rolls, and they i still paid full price for all of the rolls that i sent back. i have been going to oishii consistently over the past two years and i think its fair to say they have gone downhill."
Sal's Pizza,5,"multiple bad experiences.disrespectful, not following protocol regulations for covid manated by the state. stayed away for months. 1st time back, found bones that i nearly choked on in turkey breast."

North 26,5,"went in on a saturday for an early dinner with a last minute reservation. prices are moderately expensive. service was excellent, we really liked out server. drinks were good, i had a sangria that was pretty strong. appetizers were escargot and pate. escargot very good, pate above average, pickled bits were delicious. entrees were what disappointed me. the bouilliabase broth was very salty and felt grainy and thick. one of my mussels hadnt opened either. short ribs were much better with the seasoning on first bite and fried shallots but after a few more bites i wished there were a bit more complexity in the flavor.id say this was a good or decent meal, but cost a lot for it. again, top stars for service, just the food was a letdown."

Pressed Juicery,5,"we live nearby, so figured we had to check the place out.  we wondered how it has been open for a while but always looks empty, with never more than a table or two of people, and found out why.  food was ok but not great, and there was a weird stench in the restaurant making it hard to eat. the waiter was nice but hard to find, and they were out of both of my top choice beers on the menu.  with all the other great places in southie, dont think this is a return."

The Westland,5,understaffed tonight  the hostess didnt show  staff still upbeat and helpful. been here before  food not bad  ive heard the seafood is really good bit i dont eat seafood so cant comment. im updating my review here based on experience of family members on june 3rd for folks ate at this restaurant and all of them became ill afterwards the only thing that they had in common that they consumed was the soda which had ice in it so either the glasses arent clean the ice was contaminated or there was something else going on in the back room. overall the experience my family has being seen from this restaurant has been going downhill over the last year they were very very good but now your quality is starting to suffer.  there was an additional time we were here where we found something in the food which the staff was kind enough to tell the manager and the manager came by and compass that meal and gave us half off the remainder which i thought was nice of him but this is a reflection of what weve been seeing in this restaurant over the last year or so. i dont know if the managements changed or if the change in rules and regulations have caused them to be understaffed or if theyve had a change in staff thats cause them to be challenged

Blue Dragon,5,"i found this place several years ago and brought people i knew in the area. like an idiot i forgot about it until moving around the corner recently, and im preaching it again. the slices of pizza are not only delicious, their massive. 2 slices are the size of half a typical pizza. the glazed chicken pizza may be one of the most unique pizzas youll ever have as they blend in an italian dish with the asian aspect of being located in chinatown, and i mean this in the best way possible. this pizza place is hands down top 5 in boston for slices."

Stats Bar & Grille,5,"we went for nye, and perhaps that was our biggest mistake. we had a 745 reservation and even arrived a little earlier, but was not seated until after 8. we went for the omakase, and two cocktails. we really enjoyed the tokyo timeout. the first couple of courses came out and we were excited. the strawberry gazpacho was unique, but the oyster was muddled by pure sweetness. the next couple of courses were made only memorable by funny neighbors that shared a shot and sparked lively conversation. the lobster course was scrumptious, the pine nut rissoto had a great texture. the squab was also nice, but still the whole plate with all these elements felt disconnected. in general this was an average omakase. everything was executed perfectly but some elements didnt meld together. there were highs and lows between course. around the fourth or fifth course we started to wait over 20 minutes between courses. it was new years eve so my guess is the extra busy evening made it hard to serve our 12 course meal in a reasonable time. all in all we did not leave after rushing our dessert courses until 1130pm. it was 3.5 hour meal, which just felt ridiculous. furthermore the dessert was incredibly disappointing, the panna cotta was rubbery and the japanese cheese cake was far from cheesecake the accoutrements were lovely need to highlight the white truffle ice cream and the boujalai sauce . service tried their best, and comped our drinks and tried to rush our food. in the end the pacing of the meals and average quality is why i provided two stars, i am trying to give uni the benefit of the doubt of the nye rush and didnt just give it one star. this is probably by far my most disappointing omakase, if you are truly looking for a transformative experience i would suggest oya or cafe sushi."
Woody's Pizza,5,"great food in big quantities. i was a little apprehensive when the bar only had flavored vodka, but the bartender was great and the food more then made up for it. they had both italian and mafia movies playing on the bar tvs which was fun."

Cheers,5,"great place. not even close to average burger place. burgers are crazy. toppings are all over the map. mac and cheese, mozza sticks, onion rings, or just have the whole burger deep fried. comes with chips not fries. fries are extra. our sweet potatoe fries were well made and served quickly. fast, efficient service. burger was well cooked. the crazy toppings were all well cooked. there will be sticker shock. 2 beers, 2 burgers, fries 70 with tax and tip. but it is a great burger and you will be full, really full. they have crazy frappe but no room to try."
La Cuchara Restaurant,5,"lots of food, but overall quite bland in flavour. we ended up having to wait almost two hours to get a seat because we were a group of five and the staff was trying to fit more people in the small space they have, so let smaller groups ahead of us. overall was not with the wait."
Uno Due Go,5,"fantastic burritos, tacos, and other mexican food!"
Merengue Restaurant,4,very busy.  high end atmosphere and service with prices to match.  the food was very good and so was the wine list.

wagamama seaport,5,"so hands down one of the best experiences of my life thats an understatement. my friend took me here for my first time. hes been raving about this place for months. we came to the decision that we were going to try every food item on the menu. that we did! everything was amazing just like he said it would be. from the toasts steak tartare was my favorite, all the way to the chicken  quinoa meatballs. the food could not have been better! but remember that they are mostly small plates meant to share. thats the biggest reason we ordered the whole menu. the service was impeccable! quick, great conversations, and she staggered all the food at the right time. true gem of the boston gastro scene. the only downside that i could possibly give is the street that theyre on but if you live in boston its not that bad. come here and try to enjoy everything!"
Il Mondo Pizzeria,4,"translated by google serving ma ma, poor production.original"
Porto,4,big tasty is amazing
75 on Liberty Wharf,5,"definitely a safe bet for dim sum on the weekdays and weekend.  full service restaurant with just about all of the dim sum choices you can find, and a complete entrees menu.  food is pretty fresh and tasty.  very large seating capacity and they host banquets.  they change the table clothes, but the seats and carpets are kind of nasty which is pretty typical for chinatown.  so, dont wear your best pantsskirt and you should have no regrets."
Blue Glass Cafe,5,specialty beers and a delicious turkey reuben.
SURA BBQ Boston,4,"you gather the food items tou want grilled, grab a sauce, and the chefs grill yoir food over a giant circular griddle. a little pricey when you think about it, since its just a simple grilled dinner that you have to assemble yourself.  unless youre a big eater and can go back multiple times.  but its a fun concept, the food is fresh and the atmosphere nice for dinner and groups of people."

Abe & Louie's,1,"translated by google the price is a bit high, but the quality is equivalent.ordered the course and enjoyed the salad, steak, and dessert. for reference, the course is based on 2 people i dont feel like going alone. i would like to refer to it because it came out around  130 with taxes and tips without alcohol or drinks.first of all, the combination of blue cheese, cabbage, and bacon ingredients in the salad was quite interesting and went well together. when looking at the overall maturity, it is expected that the quality of other salads will show the corresponding quality.i liked the grilling of the rare steak, but it is a pity that the medium rare that i ordered together was not uniform. the quality of the meat was also good, and the strong scented wild mushrooms and onions that came with it also went well with the meat.i liked the quality of the dessert the most, but the chocolate cake with a strong coffee scent was quite complete, and the cramshell with the strong scent of the egg also went well with the berry.overall, i use materials with strong identities, but i feel that the materials are in harmony. if there is an ingredient that you dont like even one of the ingredients in, you may need to reconsider the order, but if you dont like the ingredients or if you like one of the ingredients, i think you can enjoy the taste.the seats are open, so you wont feel cozy, but the overall interior and atmosphere are okay. the staff were also very friendly, like two or three people at a table continuously, filling the water, asking what kind of food they were, and clearing the empty bowl. received.even though i made a reservation a week ago, i had to eat early because i was full of reservations during the evening hours, so if you are going to make a reservation, i recommend at least 2 weeks early.original      .   ,    .   2      ...  ,    130     .   , ,       .    ,           .     ,         .   ,            .    ,        ,          .           .       ,        ,                  .        ,       .                ,     ,         .1             ,      2    ."

7 Chinese Restaurant,5,worst experience ever.. first of all the restaurant was empty and still had to wait 30 min because they only had one waiter.. then when i finally got seated and the waiter took my order waited another 30 min for an appetizer. the waiter was awesome and complained to the gm about my food taking so long and the gm actually sent the waiter home for complaining... ridiculous.. who hired that gm cause obviously the werent qualified for the job.. or maybe the gm had a personal with the waiter and if thats the cause that gm should be fired... never going thier again
Rod-Dee 2 Thai Cuisine,5,amazing food awesome people!i highly recommend!
Mei Mei,5,"having been to numerous starbucks, i have to write that this at beth israel is probably the worst one ive frequented. i dont mind the wait, after all its attached to a hospital so being super busy is expected, but i mind my orders being wrong on numerous occasions. i also mind the staff being testy with me when i tell them about an incorrect order. if the other location was just a bit closer id go there but for now, i place my order and cross my fingers!"

Johnny Rockets,5,"im writing about la taqueria in roslindale because i think people should try their foods.first, you can order whatever food you want there. they make tacos, burritos, quesadillas, salads and small cakes. the burritos are thick because they add a good amount of beans and a lot of extra rice in. the tacos are filling and hot, not spicy. the quesadillas are cheesy and gooey. the salads are crunchy and full of many healthy foods. the chips are colorful. their cakes are great. you can tell the people you order from what toppings you want on your food that they have. my favorite foods are the burritos and quesadillas with black beans, cheese and rice. they have drinks that taste so good. the foods there are the best.my second reason for going to la taqueria is the setup. you can see through the glass what theyre making for your food. there are tables next to the window. you can order from your phone and they will bring it or you can do pick it up. there is internet in la taqueria. the menu is made out of a tv. after someone eats at a table there, they clean the table so you can eat and not get dirty.my third reason for loving la taqueria is the location. it is near different stores. if you are hungry you could eat there. it is near cvs and a book store, dollar tree, and it is also near a clothes store. there is a parking lot in the back so you can park in there.i hope you will like it there. have fun. written by jude the dude, a third grader in ms. taryns class"

China Taste,5,"dinner reviewthis is a review for the piatti della famiglia familystyle tasting menu at bar mezzana. i love tasting menus like this and when i was with a group with 3 other friends who are also foodies, it was a perfect opportunity to do this as they ask that everyone at the table participate. the aspect of mystery and the chef choosing for us added to the uniqueness of the experience. and for 52person, we didnt think that was very unreasonable for the amount of food we got. there is a 30 beverage pairing option which we forewent as i dont drink much and my friends were doing a dry january.for a group of 4, they did a really good job at creating 4 clear pieces of dishes so we could share easily and so it wasnt awkward. here is what was included3 different crudos one of which was the kanpachi2 crostinis one was the chicken liver, another that wasnt on the main menucarpaccioa salad with goat cheese, pomegrantes, and fennel2 pastas the spinach and ricotta ravioli and the orecchiette with sausagea beef that was not on the menu2 desserts the ginger spice cake and the caramelia chocolate mousse bombealmost every dish was delicious and would be something i order anyway, especially the crudo, the pastas, and the beef. im not a big crostini person so that wasnt my favorite. i was very happy we did the tasting menu.other pluses really nice interior and great servicei will definitely be back to bar mezzana but maybe i will get things off the menu this time."

Restaurante Montecristo,5,"when walking by the salty pig you might admire the name and the location in the heart of boston, close to the mall and the backbay tstation, but when you go inside youll also be pleasantly surprised that they offer more than gourmet pig parts.i was also really impressed by the list of italian favorites from spaghetti with meatballs and bone marrow swoon to delicious makeyourown charcuterie boards.heres what my lady friends and i created for our boardofflavors and we are the creative foodie types so i think youll be impressed too. jalapeno jelly manchego cheese assortment of mushrooms prosciutto fig jamthe only mishap was that they dont take reservations under 6 people. we were a party of four and were hungry. since there were cancellations, the waiter was able to accommodate us quicker than the original hour estimate they gave us. a quick solve!everything was delicious and paired nicely with the white pizza we ordered along with the board. try the salty pig when youre hankering good comfort italian food with a flair."

Lucky's Lounge,5,"food excellent dishes, some of which absolutely dazzled. would highly recommend the baconwrapped dates and patatas bravas off the tapas menu and the chicken pimientos off the to share menu if available.service prompt, friendly waiting staff that took good care of our table. good service makes a difference in a tapas style restaurant and they did it right.atmosphere trendy crowd, upbeat vibe. super busy till quite later in the evening. plan on waiting if you dont have a reservation and perhaps even if you do.value pricier establishment, but they do a good job of justifying it with the finer dining and exquisite flavors."

Gaslight,5,not worth the price.
Strega,5,"hot pot buffet is a staple in chinatiwn. this chinese style hot pot restaurant is open late night til 2am and they have a great variety of ingredients, more so than other more expensive hot pot locations. they serve japanese plum wine which i recommed! the only downside is that the broth is a bit mediocre in flavor sadly. the service is usually very attentive and i always enjoy my meal here. at the end of your meal you are always given complimentary oranges."

Sweet Life,3,"the pro tip here is to show up before six and grab a spot at the bar, where they serve the full menu.  the ambition is obvious, many of the dishes reference classic italian cuisine but they are all different.  the pasta is exquisite, the menu is limited, only takes a single page and the food comes when it comes, so dont be upset when you both order pasta and one dish comes out five minutes before the other."

LongHorn Steakhouse,5,"this is our goto pizza place having tried several others in the area. im only sorry we didnt go in sooner after moving to the neighborhood. dave makes a delicious pizza with a thin crust and that woodfired taste you only get from ... wait for it, burning wood. his pizza oven is like a focal point in the restaurant. its right out front, and you see the proprietor assemble your pizza, slide it into the oven, and take it out. we love his toppings. roasted garlic, not raw. caramelized onions, not raw. he has something like 30 combos, but of course you can choose your own. do not ruin the experience by taking out. the ambience is just ok, and the chairs are designed for discomfort, but you have to taste his pizza fresh from the oven. this is a friendly spot with friendly staff. im always happy there. the food is made with pride and love. try it!"

Fat Baby,4,"a couple of friends and i came here for restaurant week. we preferred to sit by a window with somewhat of a view, versus the dining room which was a bit more dark. we were sat at the end of the bar with a table and tar stools. the sun was just peaking in through the wooden blinds creating a very nice and glowing effect.we ordered different foods so we can try them out.the waitress told us as soon as we sat down after opting the restaurant week menu that there was also a filet mignon that was omitted from the printing of the menus but it was definitely an item we can order. the sides were served family style of two options. grilled summer veggies squash, zucchini and mashed potatoes. i ordered the filet mignon of course and my two friends ordered their aged strip steak. they were cooked exactly as ordered and had such wonderful flavors.we also got a salad and a soup for appetizers.for dessert, we ordered creme brule and the flourless chocolate cake. both are to die for.on the side of service  it was a lot slower than i expected with some wait between meals or waiting for our drinks to be refilled. i think its probably because its in the bar area so they tend to forget or that service just isnt the same as dining room."

Rincon Limeño,5,"this used to be my goto barrestaurant with my best friend, however i have since stopped going due to dimished customer service and hosting.first, there is a man that tries to pick up women at the bar. when i complained to staff about him, they told me he was a regular. nothing ended up happening to stop this behavior, of a 4050 year old man trying to take a 20 some year old blatantly home. additionally, i tried coming back here with friends and my dog to sit outside. the attendant had just sat another lady with her dog, and shortly proceeded to make it so difficult for me, we ended up leaving. i dont recommend this restaurant only because the service has diminished over time. otherwise, the food is great."
PURO ceviche bar,5,"this is certainly a place to check out. the restaurant is very cozy, the food was delicious, and the bathroom is kept in good condition. its a few minutes walk away from symphony. i recommend coming here for lunch. i got saigon noodle as the main dish, and for 2 extra for the lunch combo, i got a few other food items, including tofu soup and salad. theres more than enough food for one person."

Wing's Kitchen,5,the lady that took my order and made my burrito had no customer service whatsoever. then i go to eat my burrito and the whole thing was falling apart. the beef tasted old and the rice wasnt good. the best part was the sour cream which they obviously didnt make. the seagulls and pigeons liked the burrito though so i guess i paid 10 to feed the birds.
IHOP,3,"great burger, douchebag taking orders"
Milkweed,5,"i have not actually dine here. i picked up food from their ghost kitchen ghost king thai . you can order online. pick up was smooth and staff was friendly. i tried their fired chicken boxed meal with came with 2 piece of hot thai fried chicken, sticky rice, green papaya salad and shrimp chips. the chicken was crispy, moist, and super spicy. the sticky was rice was decent and the papaya salad was good. shrimp chips were airy and has a shrimp favor. their thai ice tea was perfect to wet down the food. definitely, will be back to try their other stuff"
CLINK. and The Liberty Bar,5,"this. is. the. best. food. in. billerica. i originally gave a lower star rating because of the extremely long wait if you dont call ahead 50 min for food, and i usually would not go back to a place if i ever had to wait that long but the food was just so good. now, all i do is call maybe 3045 min before i would go pick up, and its ready just in time for me to arrive. its now a regular place to visit for my coworkers and i, and if youre in billerica  you have to try it out!"

Galleria Umberto,5,"i would like to start this review by saying that michele, our server, was wonderful. she was very friendly and very attentive. the restaurant was busy and she was totally crushing her section! the service was also super quick there was hardly any wait for the food to come out. in addition, chips and salsa are waiting for you at your table. i love that.now, as a native texan from san antonio, home of some of the best tex mex in the country, i am going to give my honest opinion on the food.oh my god. the food is so bad. not inedible, but not tex mex. how dare you use the image of the great state of texas on your website?? i was excited by the prospect of build your own nachos so ordered nachos with steak, extra cheese, tomatoes, olives, and onions. most nachos feature toppings that are warm at the very least. the chips tasted like cardboard santitas are 2 a bag and they are way better yall, the tomatoes and olives were cold, the steak was chewy and the onions were raw. see attached photo.then the sopapillas. those were not sopapillas. they were basically a very heavy bread not the light puff of delicious cinnamon sugar that it was meant to be.the margaritas were... fine. they were more ice than anything else.i will not be returning to this establishment, as i would rather put my money towards a flight to texas to get the real thing."
Wonder Spice Cafe,3,hole in the wall

La Gran Manzana,3,get the scallion pancake with roast beef. thank me later!
Durgin-Park Restaurant,5,"like most dunkies you know what your getting, quick service and low prices. this place is tucked away at the back of the food court and theres little on the outside of the building to tell whats in here so walked pasted it at first. theres a reasonable amount of seating inside. the only drawback was that is it was  up some steps to get to the counter and although they do have a disabled elevator to take you up this was partly blocked by a table  chairs so if you was in a wheelchair your probably going to have a problem getting passed."

North Street Grille,3,they sell halal chicken. i bought chicken soup from them. it was light and gentle for my stomach.
Club Café,5,"absolutely disappointing. avoid brunch here at all cost.ordered the saltie burger, torched salmon belly, and extra fries for curbside pickup. first of all, the curbside pickup service was way below my expectation. the staff on the phone told me to arrive in 25 mins, and i arrived on time. however, by the time i got there, they didnt come out for 10mins despite notifying them of my arrival few minutes before i arrived.in terms of food, the burger initially seemed okay, but i realized that the patty was a mess  i asked for med rare, but as in the picture, the patty was barely cooked at all. the fries on the side was also very soggy and i eventually ended up throwing out most of it. the torched salmon belly 19 was a huge rip off. for the price, you get a very small portion  half small avocado, 4 salmon belly slices, and diced cucumbers and apples. i would rather pay more for a more quality product than waste money on something i can barely taste. overall, contrary to all the reviews that say this place is fantastic, i can confidently say that this place is not wort a visit, especially for a weekend brunch."

Ruth's Chris Steak House,4,"im not a fan of their tortillas that they use so i always get the burrito bowl and it is one of the best bowls around. i get the steak with refried beans and guac  it comes with lettuce and salsa. it comes in a metal tin which is great if you dont eat it all because the next day you can heat it up in the oven or toaster oven. the one in fenway is nice, it has outdoor seats and some indoor as well. dont come during peak lunch or dinner as you will have to wait but they are pretty fast so if you dont mind a 15min wait then come whenever!"

Bullfinchs,5,"we went to srv shortly after they were named in bostons best. the staff were very friendly and were able to accommodate a last minute change to the reservation.atmosphere 55we were lucky enough to sit outside in their outdoor courtyard area. the vinecovered exterior walls surrounding the courtyard, makes the outdoor area quite an awesome spot to dine. highly recommend you try and sit outside.food 35we were somewhat disappointed with the food. while it was by no means bad food, we just had high expectations based on the reviews. what stole the show for use were the appetizers. while small and expensive, they were the highlight of the night.we had almost every pasta dish on the menu the night we were there. most dishes were underseasonsed which was a let down.overall, good experience at srv.alas..."
Beijing Cafe,5,"the staff was polite, attentive and helpful. it felt like everyone went out of their way to make our lunch perfect during the lunch rush on a weekday. the chef offered to create a custom salmon nigiri  apetizer for our group and it was amazing. very reasonable price especially considering the area and definitely somewere im going to go out of my way to eat at again."

Shake Shack,4,the place is overrated. the icecream was average. the flavors lack the taste. the fish cone is whats running this place. the cone has a strong flavor of egg. i would just go here for a instagram post or a story. would rather go to amorino for a good icecream. the people who serve the icecream are very greeting. laso would not go here on a coldwindy night. this place can seat only up to 5 people.
Ocean Prime,5,"nice veggie options. every single item on their menu can be made vegetarian. if you dont mind a sugar rush, you can try thier old school frappes. inferno burger is their most flavourful burger and is a must have."

Kaju Korean Cuisine — Kenmore,5,"ginger garden, before this epic covid19 bs, we would frequent gg at least 3 times a month for hibachi. food and service always excellent. the chefs are entertaining as well as experienced at their craft. atmosphere is fun and inviting. tables are always clean, food always fresh. they have a private function type room for larger parties. we have tried the sushi, only the california rolls, so not a great example, that being said, it is always fresh and tasty. since covid, we have enjoyed their take out chinese food on multiple occasions. they have done an excellent job keeping their staff and clients safely distancing while picking up our orders. we have had a few dishes, mostly apps, one of our favorites is the chicken lowmein. overall we have not had a bad experience eating in, or take out from ginger garden."

Frontera Grill,5,"while wendys is one of my favorite fastfood chains due to the higher standard of quality in terms of ingredients, the staff here has the tendency to drop the ball. be advised that visiting the store after the dining room has closed often leads to long drivethru waits or low quality food prep. visit during peak meal hours for the a fresher experience or during the weekend days for a higher quality preparation."

The Oceanaire Seafood Room,2,"i came here for my birthday.ordered the tea service  antoinette which contained scotch, chamomile, italicus, aperol,  honey. the price was 50. it is recommended to share with at least 2 people and for good reason my boyfriend and i both left drunk this was a pleasant surprise since other reviewers mentioned the drinks being watered down. it felt like taking a bunch of shots.also in case you were wondering the tea was iced not hot we werent quite sure what to expect since it came in a tea kettle.we also ordered the shrimp which contained garlic fried shrimp, kashmiri chili spicy tikka sauce, curry leaves  lime. the price was 17. i thought the shrimp was just okay. i came in expecting small portions so we were fine with that but it wasnt anything worth writing home about."

Stoddard's Fine Food & Ale,4,"need cashiers, not computer screens. to confusing. not clean"
CLINK. and The Liberty Bar,5,"if you want a place that takes their italian cooking serious and to its roots, this is the place. the waiter had a strong italian accent and showed his passion for true italian cuisine. they have a large wine selection and wide array of cocktails. the seafood was cooked perfectly, especially the monkfish and swordfish. i also highly recommend the ravioli with mushrooms, ravioli with veal and short rib, and the meatballs."

Artu,3,"fish and chips great. hot, cramped, and unimpressive service."
Chilli Thai Bistro,4,"hmmm!, as i heard its the best place for breakfast for entire shrewsbury. however, its not up to the mark or not good as per expectations, may be because of the huge crowd. waiting time was 1520 mins for us. as we know its hard to maintain the quality where there is a increase in the quantity.i hope they take care these busy situations."

Casa De Nana,5,"texas roadhouse was one of my favorite restaurants. the last couple of months its been going downhill but tonight was the absolute worst. the restaurant was filthy, the quality of the food was poor. the management only seemed interested in getting as many people in and out as possible. i have been a loyal customer for years and even told her that i was not going to come back because of the experience. she wasnt concerned, probably because it was very busy. it wont always be that way then they will miss the loyal customers they chased away."

Rino's Place,5,the food here is so good

Winsor Dim Sum Café,5,"really nice place for ayce korean bbq. they have 2 menus to chose from, either a, cheaper one with less options, or b, a slightly more expensive one that includes the first menus options and more. my friends and i went for option a, and we loved the spicy pork, prime brisket, and pork belly. i felt like option a had plenty of options for us, with different meats, soup, scallion pancake, etc. they also give you many side dishes as usual and you can ask for rice. the downsides were that there were no exhaust pipes or fans or anything so the restaurant feltsmelled very smoky as food cooked, and it was difficult to call the waiter over and get service as with many ayce restaurants."
Maurizio's,5,slices were huge  tasty. i dont usually like thin crust but if i were in the area again i would come back.
Archie's New York Deli,5,"i ate here a week ago and i cant wait to go back! im still dreaming of the soupy dumplings. the udon noodles are fresh and delicious, they taste like they just made them. the staff is nice, my only wish was that the tables were bigger... or maybe i just need to order less food.... nah bigger tables! everything on the menu is delicious portions are generous and its really affordable. looking for an excuse to go back soon!"
Summer Shack,4,"what happened to this place?!used to be great but the last few times just got the saddest burgers. overcooked, dry, barely any of the toppings, wrong cheese. i suspect the patties might be cooked way ahead of time and sitting around for awhile if the cooled down cheese is any indication.no offense, but its like the staff doesnt give a sh1t.the other locations are still great"

Cafe Quattro,5,"this place should be a foodies heaven and they must come for that pilgrimage! a small space with no fancy fair, where parties have to share tables most often, yet, there could be 40 people wait listed at peak hours. so whats the surprise? food is fabulous, yet very reasonably priced. nothing i have ever had there was ever less than awesome! they do exceptionally good with fish dishes! try anything you want. freshness as well as simplicity of ingredients is also the key.only remember they take the longest to get the dumplings to you. i think because they make it fresh from scratch. so if you want them to arrive before your entrees, do mention!"
Cheers,4,"combination ramen and sushi place with a focus on using the unusual koshihikari brown rice which some people feel is healthier than fully milled rice.   place has a relaxed, casual vibe, suitable for just dropping in with friends.  small beer and wine list, fast service, reasonable prices considering the back bay location."

Kelley Square Pub,5,great five guys location! the service is fast and friendly. burgers and shakes are always fresh and yummy.
Canton Eatery,5,"i am a korean food lover. i make it at home, and i love to go out for it. sadly, boston just doesnt have many options for korean food, and korean garden was equally disappointing.despite korean gardens low reviews, lack of options convinced us to try it out. but, at a high price point and with mediocre food, we left with the distinct impression we would rather brave our korean cravings than return."
MIJA Cantina & Tequila Bar,5,"we came here for restaurant week! but they do offer a prix fixe menu all year round! its a small little italian restaurant near city hall in the basement of a building. food and service were great! i got the crab raviolis, lobster fra diavolo, and tiramisu. the pasta was delicious both courses and dessert was very tasty! fra diavolo was not spicy at all but had a little kick to it. everything was very flavorful and pasta itself was done perfectly al dente. though i must admit their chocolate cake seemed like a better choice than my tiramisu. only complaint is that it is so dark down there we could not see each other or the food we were eating! also since its so small, remember to make a reservation!"

Granary Tavern,4,best indian in the boston area!
Bon Me,3,"we went earlier this week, sat out on the patio met bar patio during covid. hosts werent very friendly and often on their phones instead of talking to guests. but the food was delicious. we had oysters, foie gras toast highly recommend, but it was too rich for two people, fish sticks and the famous burger. wouldnt get the burger again as the lobster was so small on top of the bun. the fries were very good though. service was slow, but we enjoyed the atmosphere. the watermelon drink was a must have. frose was good as well."

Lucky Strike Fenway,5,"the food was great and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive, even on a busy night. even though i chose the medium spiciness level, it tasted spicier than that. i love spicy food, so it didnt bother me. the seafood tasted fresh and good, and left me wanting more. i want to give this place 5 stars, but theres some things that can be improvedthey ran out of sausages the night i went, so i didnt get to try that out as a side yet. this isnt a big deal as i plan on going back to try the other flavors anyways.they dont serve any beers or alcohol to go with the good food yet, just water and soda.this was the biggest and probably the only real negative thing about this place on the night that i went, the music coming from next door, brighton music hall, was so loud that we were able to feel the bass and vibrations. it was loud to the point where it cut out the music from the restaurant, was a bit distracting when youre trying to have a conversation, and was a bit annoying."
Ocean Prime,5,great french food with outstanding views.

Tikkaway Grill,3,"the restaurant was fine, portions were huge but its hard to notice on the menu the disclaimer that everyone has to order 7.50 worth of entrees or appetizers. its understandable but we just werent prepared when we ordered. the food was also fine but didnt blow me away. standing outside for a hour waiting for a table did though they quoted us 30 minutes. also understandable in a popular neighborhood, but not my jam. if youre going to wait that long my experience is that theres better food elsewhere."
Maggiano's Little Italy,3,that clam chowda though........amazing!!!.fishermans plate...wowza!!and lets not forget the yummy cole slaw with raisins!!!

Audubon,5,great bbq. short rib is the best!
Uno Pizzeria & Grill,5,super fresh and tasty.
Boston Chowda Company,5,"drove an hour up to boston just to try these after seeing the hype online. let me just say it was worth it! yes the lines are crazy because they just opened, but the wait can vary quite a bit depending on time of day. we ordered one straight outta japan and one custom custard taiyaki, strawberry mango ice cream, condensed milk, and unicorn sprinkles as well as a taro slush. the taro flavor is very mild and not overly sweet and the cotton candy sprinkles on top are a great addition. the straight outta japan felt like a great representation of a more japanese flavor palette with the red bean paste,  matcha and hojicha roasted matcha ice cream, and mochi. very mild earthy flavors and not too sweet. the custom one was our favorite. the mango and strawberry ice cream has just the right amount of acidity and brightness that make it perfect any time, but especially in warmer weather. the condensed milk lent it a rich sweetness that balanced it out. the unicorn sprinkles and decorations are not just adorable, but tasty as well. i believe the ears and horn are fondant or similar, but not sickeningly sweet. we loved it so much we drove by later in the day to grab a second round, but the line was much longer. we will absolutely be back again and i cant wait for them to introduce their fluffy pancakes!"
Loco Taqueria & Oyster Bar,4,"overall quick, easy, and delicious! lukes is a must if youre in the mood for lobster but dont need a waitedon experience.the good the lobster roll was incredible. not too buttery, well portioned, and stuffed into fresh bread. other rolls that ive had used poor bread and it really does make a difference. the mac n cheese that we ordered was equally as delicious with hefty chunks of lobster spread throughout. the cole slaw wasnt mayo based, which was refreshing and paired well with the roll. lastly, the cookies extra , while expensive, were a perfect note to end on. the atmosphere is easy and straightforward, just walk in, order, and sit down.the notsogood the prices are a bit too much if youre coming for lunch or a casual dinner, and we spent 65 for two people. they didnt have any fries which i was craving to go along with my roll, just chips probably better for my health anyway. the mac n cheese took a bit to come out too, roughly 10 mins.atmosphere 810service 910food 910"
Pizza Talia,4,located inside of back bay station. this is a great place to grab a burger and fries on the way home or while waiting for your train. weather your a student or not i suggest on going for the starving student combo. allows you to purchase a burger tall boy beer and a side of fries for just 10.

Applebee's Grill + Bar,3,"wonderful waterfront location excellent menu for real steak lovers, worth the money."
Olive Garden,1,"this applebees is getting worse and worse.  i tend to stick to my normal meals when im here and the portion sizes seem to be getting smaller. and the quality seems to be getting worse. the chicken on the 4cheese honey pepper chicken used to be good chicken tenders. now they are slim, always over cooked, and to crispy. the sauce that is suppose to be on them is almost non existent now.    the salads have been brown multiple times.  have sent them back and fresher ones have come out the appetizer portions always seem to be different. and in the same batch of wings have gotten over cooked ones with ok ones. ones that are heavily sauced and ones that have barely any sauce.    i will say staff here has never been anything but nice.   and the drinks seem to still be as mediocre as any restaurant chain."
Purple Shell,5,"food was edible but not particularly tasty. chai was not good either. but for a quick bite, its decent."
FLORINA Pizzeria & Paninoteca,5,great place to spend delays and layovers. very good quick service and good selection of drinks.

Oath Pizza - South Station,5,excellent burger!
Papa's Pizza Company,3,"i had to duck and loved it, the waitress and the service was incredible."
Cornish Pasty Co,4,"went here for fathers day 2019 and i totally regret bringing my family here.the space is super cramped and super cold! its hard to walk around in here because everything is so tightly packed together. its dark, the ceilings are low and its extremely cold. felt like i was in a dungeon. my food got cold right away because our table was right under a vent. other customers were complaining about the cold too. when we asked, we were told that its controlled by the building owner its in a shared building, not by them so they cant change it and that they often get complaints. that sucked.our table was in the corner and we had maybe 2 feet of space between us and the booths across from us. right beside us there was a small round room with a round table and our backs were touching the backs of the guests that were sitting in there. it was terrible! my niece even dropped her plate on the floor by accident because as she was walking by to sit, the lady on the other table adjusted herself slightly and pushed my niece over by mistake. it wasnt her fault, just the layout of the place is horrid so its hard to be comfortable.the food was just ok. nothing id ever recommend or even remember. the best part i guess was the burgers and that was literally just burger meat, bread and plastic cheese. the raw buffet itself was not well kept... the foods were falling into each others containers, contaminating each other and there was a ton of raw meat and rice on the floor. it was not pleasant whatsoever. its like the containers didnt have enough space between each other. it was also confusing because people were walking all over the place grabbing what they wanted, there was no set line or direction of where to go.the service was mediocre. we didnt know who our waitress was until the very end of our meal because no one came to our table so we would just ask for what we needed to whoever walked by. they would however bring it themselves and didnt bother asking someone else to do it, so that was nice.i did not like that they included an 18 tip on the bill. its not that im against tipping, i always tip and i dont mind, but i dont like being told how much to tip or feeling like im forced to. when we left the restaurant we were talking about this outside and another group who had just finished dining asked us what we meant. we showed them our receipt and they hadnt even noticed that their receipt had the tip included on it as well. so they ended up double tipping... they were very upset and i imagine that scenario happens really often.if there were any positive to my visit id say that i like that its unlimited food so i got to try out almost everything did not have any seafood, it looked unsanitary to me because they were all touching and just... no. i also had the pina coladastrawberry daquiri mix and it was delicious!the concept of the restaurant itself is great, but the execution definitely needs work. ive visited fireice in providence a few years back and i enjoyed it very much.overall i did not have a good experience at the boston location. i drove all the way from providence to boston since the fireice we had in prov shut down. i guess it was for good reason!"

Clover Food Lab,4,"excellent food, have already been back twice!"
North Street Grille,5,"overallthis is probably the best sushi restaurant in boston area, which is sad. it still doesnt meet my fivestar standard. if i am paying more than 250 per person, i expect everything to be phenomenal.decorit is very interesting that all these expensive japanese restaurant love a subtle entry. so subtle that i couldnt even find the door. the decor is classy as expected, but nothing extraordinary.servicethe service is good based on my expectation, but not great. one thing to note, they charge you 75 for no show.foodi personally dont like creative sushi. most sushi here are pretty creative, but i feel that the simplest sushi tells how skillful the chef is."
Taiwan Cafe,5,"small quaint restaurant close to the airport and wthin easy walking distance of the blue line. not too busy at 6pm on a monday. promptly seated and got a good table by the window. decent house merlot and basket of crusty bread. menu selections all looked good but i decided on the veal and spinach special. came with a small very fresh salad and a side of the house pasta. entree was very good and not too heavy. i decided, based on the recommendation of the gentleman at the adjacent table to get the tiramisu and espresso for desert.however, i was not offered any desert and was brought the check. not a huge issue, desert would have been an overindulgence. i decided to order one to go for breakfast in the morning when the server picked up the check. waited over 10 minutes while the servers occupied themselves elsewhere. finally had to go up to the station to pay, was annoyed to say the least. so, on a balance of 4 for food and 2 for service, rating is 3."
Union Bar and Grille,3,"great atmosphere, food and staff. if you want something spicy they will ask you twice so be careful with your requests it can be very spicy."

New Market Pizza,5,great diner and good atmosphere but food quality depends on when you go.. they had one great cook. i dont know if he still works there. the cook with the tattoos and facial hair. when he cooks the food is amazing.. if you get anyone else the food is average at most. especially when the owner is cooking. shes actually a nice lady but her cooking yea.. not soo much
Crazy Stone,4,excellent food very expensive
Bleacher Bar,5,good pizzia have it your way and an all the time friendly staff
Restaurante Montecristo,5,"a robot cooks your food, and it tastes great too! very busy at lunchtime, with good reason. menu is a short list of customizable stirfry bowls and you can watch the robot cook in front of you. there are vegetarian and vegan options and you can add and subtract specific ingredients, but the drinks are unsweetened and not great. paying with cash looks like it might be inconvenient, but otherwise the ordering kiosks are handy. its definitely a novelty to try at least once."
Gaga Seafood Restaurant,5,"used to be friendly costumer service, not anymore... tried to order the crispy fried, was told they got just regular, tried to get breast, was told only legs and tights... was sunday about 1 pm. cant believe they were short on product and the place was not busy. go figure..."

Silvertone Bar & Grill,5,"the food was mediocre, too spicy. there wasnt enough variety in the menu."
The Capital Grille,5,"this restaurant has been in the fenway neighborhood for years. its tucked away down a residential street. enjoy the outdoor dining when the weather is warm. the staff are very nice. i had drunken noodle with tofu, however its been better in the past when ive eaten here. ive had several curry and noodle dishes before and can say theyve all been great. if youre visiting any of the museums or attending a red sox game in the area, this is worth a trip!"

TGI Fridays,4,"we had brunch, one of the dishes came with fried egg on top, the egg was raw and not flavorful at all the potatos were probably the most flavor we got on our plates. is a cute set up and easy to order. great for vegetarians, just wished i ordered something different, i will give them a second try.update i had the chicken wrap with the potatoes and that was far better than the brunch we got the first time, also lower in price"
Winsor Dim Sum Café,3,"hole in the wall casual spot for takeout chinese bbq. entre combos available which are one to three types of meat, rice and cabbage plus miso soup. large selection of meats available but i usually stick to the pork and duck which are consistently delicious. they also offer bbq by the pound and whole roast pig, duck and chicken. prices are relatively cheap and the two meat combo comes out to less than 9 which is great on a student budget. seating is available here if needed and can be crowded at the lunch and dinner rush but always moves quickly."
Bostonia Public House,5,a great place with familiar options such as soups and sandwiches. classic for any occasion or simple place to do work. panera is a great place for board meetings too!

Charleys Philly Steaks,4,love their donuts.
Five Guys,1,"my friends and i had a great experience eating at spring shabushabu. the place is kept very clean, which allowed us to focus entirely on our food. each of us were given a personal hot pot, which can be overwhelming youve never had hot pot before. we got to order meat from the menu, which costs extra, and choose from the buffets selection, which is included in the base price. believe me, everything you could ever want is in the buffet, and you can feel full and sated without having to order any meat. a must go if youre an asian that loves hot pot, or if youre want to explore this unique dish."

Bar Louie,5,delicious pizza for very cheap!
Sufra Mediterranean Food,5,not the friendliest staff very slow operation.  came in on saturday morning and had to spend about 20 minutes getting a bagel with two eggs and cheese. i am from new york and these are not close to authentic new york bagels. these bagels are much smaller although they are pretty tasty. the way they make the bagels is also kind of gross.  they have no system and are bumping into each other. the ingredients dont look fresh
Red Mango,4,always super nice service and the food is incredibly tasty. i appreciate the meat free choices i get here!
Harry’s All American,4,"1st time was great. food was great, coldbrew was delicious. 2nd time i went thru for my order wrong and the chai was very bland. tequila sunrise bagel sandwich is on point though."

Rodey Pizzeria & Pasta,5,this is the best modern japanese restaurant in boston. they are not making food. they are making art.
Bencotto,4,"translated by google the restaurant is very small, there are many people standing in line. the food is good but the arepa they gave me with the paisa tray didnt taste like anything. the place is not very economical compared to the food here in colombia. the sweets delivered to you at the end make you remember colombia. passion fruit juice is delicious but very sweet compared to what they serve in colombia. chicken rice is delicious as well as all dishes. a great variety of colombian dishes that make you feel at home. the waiters do not always answer the call. the very cozy place.originales muy pequeo el restaurante, hay mucha gente haciendo fila parada. la comida es buena pero la arepa que me dieron con la bandeja paisa no saba a nada. no es muy econmico el lugar comparado con la comida de ac de colombia. los dulces que te entregan al final te hacen recordar a colombia. el jugo de maracuy est delicioso pero muy dulce a comparacin al que sirven en colombia. el arroz con pollo es delicioso as como todos los platos. una gran variedad de platos colombianos que te hacen sentir como en casa. los meseros no siempre responden al llamado. el lugar muy acogedor."

The Q,4,"a solid place for a solid steak or meal. bar is really great depending on the bartender. food is very tasty but some questions about quality. ordered a wagyu and though delicious was definitely not a wagyu. to be clear nothing is bad, but for the price they charge not everything is exceptional."
"The White Bull Tavern | Boston's Best Comedy, Nightclub, Restaurant",5,"good food at a price that wont make your wallet sad. portion sizes are pretty generous even when im ravenous a full portion fills me up, and often as not ill end up saving half my meal for the next day.they may not be the most wonderful thai restaurant ever, but the only time ive ever been disappointed with their food was when i ordered something not realizing it had eggplant in it i hate eggplant. the only real complaint i can come up with is that the restaurant is too small, and lunch rush packs the house, making it difficult to get in even to pick up a togo order."
wagamama,5,"spur of the moment restaurant choice just due to the proximity to park st. t station. good thing i wasnt voracious when i got there, however with the amount of time i waited for food, it quickly turned into disappointment.my friend ordered a lamb sandwich and received his order within minutes. i realized after 5 minutes of waiting that i should have ordered something else besides the chicken plate for 11. ugh after i placed my order the guy behind the register did not give me any warning, which i would have appreciated that it would take forever 25 minutes. there were about 4 people total in the restaurant. unfortunately i had to check with them multiple times and he seemed extremely disinterested. when i finally received my food it was only ok and my friend had already finished his sandwiches.these mediterranean  falafel places are seriously a dime a dozen in boston, you have plenty of other options. bonapita, shawarma falafel, etc..."

Chilacates Amory St,5,"ill premise this review by saying i didnt eat here, and this rating is based off the service, not the food.i didnt eat because i immediately mentioned my shellfish allergy, and i was told they only have fish, specifically haddock.however, i noticed they had shrimp as soon as i picked up the menu, and shrimp is clearly a shellfish.otherwise, i probably would have given a 1 star review because i would have ordered, ate and ended up in the emergency room.allergies beware."
Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers,5,"love this place. food is excellent, staff is friendly"
Bukowski Tavern,5,"first off no mashed potato how dose that happen. then the new chicken crispy sandwich they where all out, then no salads at all i want to know how this happens. my son went to ask for a refill on his drink and waited at the counter for 10 min. i would be ok with that but there was like 8 people on shift with 1 coustermer getting waited on by 3 employees and a manager . they need to get there act together"

Phinista Cafe,2,"blaze pizzas are all pretty consistent. fresh ingredients and pizzas are just the right size to be really satisfying without making you too full. good value. only drawback is that is can take a while if theres a line, but id say it is worth it, particularly at this location."
La Parrilla Restaurant,5,good food great service !!! 
Asian Garden Restaurant,5,"i didnt have an interest in going to red lantern since ive heard a ton of poor reviews from my friends about the food, but some of my friends had a groupon deal so i decided to tag along with them. i didnt have very high expectations for this place and unsurprisingly they didnt exceed any preconceived notions. we arrived at 725 for our 730 reservation only to be seated at 750 at a table that the hostess knew had a slight issue the ac above was dripping down onto our seats, tables, and floor. they said it was from the humidity, but ive been to a ton of restaurants in humid areas and this shouldnt happen. we then requested to move, which the host staff wasnt happy about, and they sat us at a 67 person round table for 4 people  which is uncomfortable and awkward because how do you sit and eat and socialize at a table so big with so few people surprise, you dont. we asked to move to a 4top right next to table we were at and they said no, that table was specifically reserved for a group that was arriving soon...we ended up staying at our table, the service was the slowest ive ever had in my life including 3 michelin star restaurants that have tasting menus. it took us about an hour from when we sat down to receive our food and drinks, then another hour to receive the rest of our food and second round of drinks and then over 30mins for them to charge our credit cards!!! the only thing they comped was a measly 10 appetizer...needless to say i wont be going back. the food is good, good portions, but it is over priced, wait staff is rude and excruciatingly slow. lucky for me i was with great friends so spending 2.5 hours with them is fun regardless of the situations."
The Bebop,4,"excellent food for the price and we had great service. a comfortable, dark paneling. relaxing no pressure but still a bit formal making it a nice place for a date."
Joe's On Newbury,5,best burritos in the entire area. no contest. worth the walk from northeastern. try it! you will not be disappointed.

The Glenville Stops,4,"if you want to enjoy french starters, they have the foie gras. if you want to enjoy french desserts, they have the tarte tatin, sabl breton or crme brle. if you want the french atmosphere, they set up tables outside during spring and summer. all this without leaving boston"
Tony C's Sports Bar & Grill - Fenway,5,"i tried the lunch buffet and it was good. they had 3 vegetarian options which is better than most places.food tasted fresh and good. the naan served with buffet was fresh and very tasty.i believe service can be improved. we wanted to order a coke but waiter never checked with us, our glasses were filled with water right away and then no one came back."

Chilacates Amory St,4,one of my all time favorite restaurants. my favorite dish is the lemongrass chicken on rice. i will usually substitute the plain rice for fried rice and also add a fried egg on top. adding cold milk tea as drink for a perfect meal!
Uni,4,"def my favorite place in boston. why cant we have more places like this?! soo, my recommendations would be all the tacos and guacamole. yeah, i know it sound basic, but they are delicious! the only problem with puro is that they dont take reservations over the phone, which is both a feature and a bug.in a word, puro, i love you!"
Kings Dining & Entertainment,3,"great place and fast to grab a bite. the chicken plate is delicious with chicken, rice, lettuce and a pita."
Eastern Pearl,4,"my wifes company does some regular events here and over the years ive become pretty disenchanted with grill 23. the food is decent, but their bar service is horrible. after ordering a drink with a specific bourbon i watched as the bartender instead filled the glass with the cheapest makers mark at the bar. ive found that i have to specify everything exactly on even simple drinks or they come back filled with strange addins and cheap liquor that ruin the cocktail. honestly i dont think the place is really deserving the numerous accolades it receives from the local reviews."
Saltie Girl,5,the food was nice thats all i can say
Los Arrieros,5,always ordering carryout3 toppings large pizzagood servicegood tasteand nice location to pick up food and head homeplace is clean if you want to sit down and eat the pizzarecommended thingorder takeout and sit down to eat the pizza its super hot and super yummm
P & R Restaurant,3,translated by google the staff is very distracted. they dont wear gloves to cook food. they do not cover their hair to make the food warm and they are always in a bad mood. thats why i stopped going to that placeoriginalel personal es muy distraido .   no usan guantes para cevir la comida. no se cubren el pelos para cervir la comida y siempre estan de mal humor.  por eso ya deje de ir a ese lugar
Angela's Cafe Eagle Hill,1,if you are looking for a breakfast sandwich this is your place. make everything fresh to order and the menu is extensive. also good for typical lunch staples. not the place to go if you are looking to be healthy but a great spot to cure a hangover!

Siano's Italian Pizzeria & Restaurant,4,"4 stars for the food and service and another star for the nice outdoor eating area. i enjoyed the gryo dinner plate which came with a healthy portion of chicken, fries, and a salad. the chicken was a bit dry but when eaten with the pita like bread they give you and the tzatziki sauce it was great! this is a great spot to eat at in the summer because of the outdoor seating they provide. i had enough food left over from the dinner plate to eat as a lunch the next day."
Tip Tap Room,5,this is good but isnt the best place that ive had visited.
Piccolo Nido,5,"the chicken rice plate it very good. bukhlawa dessert is very tasty and fresh in the lunch hours. the red and white sauces add good taste to the food. they end up finishing the food very early in the afternoons that youve to wait for rice or chicken to be cooked. that is the only downside of this place. sometimes during lunch, some musician plays persian music with their traditional instrument. long lines during lunch hours. prices are decent."
Harry’s All American,5,great food. i recommend flames.

Clover Food Lab,5,always get my coffee right and they are fast
Doña Habana Restaurant,5,"i was looking forward to try amateras ramen as i saw a lot of good reviews from google and yelp. i tried the yokohama tonkotsu. for a 13.50 excluding tax and tips bowl of noodles, i do expect better quality and fresher ingredients. the vegetable was overcooked with a side of thinly sliced raw onions and half a soft boiled egg. the broth was too heavy and salty for my taste. the ramen taste like noodles you can buy from the chinese grocery market. overall, im disappointed with this ramen experience."
Honga,5,huge burgers at a pretty good price right in the middle of davis square!
Hojoko,5,"delicious chocolates and tasty beverages....one of the better places to stop by for a fine cup of coffee, cake,  chocolates...."

Friendly's,2,expensive but amazing
New Shanghai,5,"its loud, its boisterous, and most importantly an authentic italian experience. it doesnt pretend to be a chic, modern setting for cozy boring procedural meals, nor should it.its an excellent place emphasizing its signature mastery of southern italian pizzas and select dishes.hang on now, its not all rosy.. the dessert menu leaves a bit to be desired, however that will be a common theme in the north end. a place where proprietors will naturally focus more on filling their own pockets vs a symbiotic one stop shop customer centric experience. overwhelmingly in this area, the margins are thin, and the willingness to improve is thinner.after your meal head to modern pastry for dessert. youll be more satisfied"
Cafe Jaffa,5,luv it!! finally a good seafood place in spfld!
Pho & I House Of Noodle And Rice,4,perfection

Soup Shack JP,5,very creative and delicious food based on the cuisine of venice. friendly service and a solid wine list.
Tilted Kilt Pub and Eatery (Boston),5,"fabulous! a very hidden jewel, but well worth searching out. the atmosphere is dark. wooded and very comfortable and romantic. the menu is very different and delicious...you must try the roasted cauliflower. the service is very fine...they seemed to anticipate our every need and were spot on with their suggestions.though the wine list is a bit common, their spirits whiskey, vodka, single malt, etc. is perhaps the best that i have seen.i would personally have preferred hearing the mellow sounds of sinatra, nat king cole, johnny mathis, etc. rather than the 60s rock, but that may just be me."
FiRE+iCE,4,good takeout
Wai Wai,4,excellent irish pub serving great beer and amazing food. lobster blt and a smithwicks beer is definitely recommended!

Row 34,5,"i love the burgers at shake shack. they always seem to be warm and fresh. the staff is courteous and friendly. if you get a chance, also try the chicken shack. its delicious!!ive heard from others, that the app does not really work well, and you actually end up waiting longer by using the app then if you just go into the restaurant and order.my only criticism is they actually call you before your food is ready. if the food is not ready and waiting at the window, then the buzzer should not be going off!one of the good things about shake shack, is that the tables always seem to be clean. they have a guy that does a really great job of making sure the tables are taken care of. im not sure what his name is, but he definitely deserves a raise! he is a model employee!"
by CHLOE. - Back Bay,1,"great gyros, coming from someone that grew up in greece. the pitas sandwiches in this place are quite traditional, and really resemble a street food pita gyros you find in greece. one of the best gyro places in the area around boston.tip consider replacing tzatziki with yoghurt, adding mustard and paprika if you like them.chicken and pork skewers are also very good as is the falafel. i tried the egg lemon soup. it was practically chicken soup i would prefer a stronger egg lemon flavor but still surprisingly good.i have my eyes on the gyro salad, i believe its worth a try."

Pauli's,5,"i went to this place after being suggested by many friends. lets start with the good thing nice ambiancedecor and thats all. the first inconvenience was lipstick mark on my friend water glass. we brought up to our waiter attention and he didnt even apologize for this major red flag. then, it took a solid 20 minutes to bring a total of 5 drinks, we didnt get not explanation as to why it took so long? i asked where the wayu came from meaning the ranchs name and he replied was japan. very rude.we order 4 items calamari, wayu roll, crab, and tuna poke we only received 3 items and when we mentioned to our server that we were missing the calamari 20 minutes later, because that what it took him to check up on our table.  again he didnt apologize or show some kind of empathy and brought a cold calamari 2 minutes. the experience was horrendous due to our server  the drinks are okay  the food is just average  and the price super overrated! its poor delivery for peruvian food!"

Red Lantern Restaurant & Lounge,5,"very very good. eat here! the two of us came in on a slow sunday afternoon, and the service was exceptional. the place has a very cool playful vibe with an open kitchen, and all the staff have a friendly and open attitude to match. wide selection of local massachusetts beers on tap. our server recommended a few to us and we tasted a few before ordering a glass of mystic saison. appetizers exceeded our expectations. the garlic knots had a great toasty garlicky buttery flavor without being greasy, and were nicely complimented by the fresh tomato sauce. the chicken wings were crispy and tender, dusted with a unique morrocan spice blend. very fragrant. the server graciously brought out a sample of the spice blend for us to smell. they came with an excellent rich lebneh dip, which i loved, and we also requested ranch dressing, which we are accustomed to ordering with wings. the ranch was the best weve ever had. it was freshly made, herby and citrusy. for main, we ordered the pepper pizza, with the pickled fresno peppers. great! spicy and flavorful and tender. we thought the pizza crust here was even better than at their original location in area 4 of cambridge. they do a great job of matching toppings together for their pizzas. the chef was going over the specials for the evening with the staff, and let us try two slices of their special hawaiian pizza. it was excellent. brick oven roasted pineapple, tender smoked and roasted ham, with the fresno peppers to balance the sweetness with some heat. chef also sent some complimentary desserts chocolate pudding with creme fraiche and large salt flakes. we ate every last drop! truly an exceptional experience. would highly recommend to anyone in the area."

Pat's Place,4,"great ambiance even on a dreary afternoon. wish that the stools had seat backs and that there was a foot rail, but not a deal breaker. the chowder 2nd pic was quite good but the roast beef sandwich was the star of the meal. ridiculously comforting and delicious but without a subsequent food coma. ill have to swing back for dinner sometime!"

Paris Seaport Bar + Creperie,4,"boston doesnt have a michelin guide and if it did, lespalier is the sort of restaurant to easily grab a star. housed in an inconspicuous location right near the entrance to the mandarin oriental on boylston, it would be easy to pass this everyday with little thought.of course, lespalier is built on a reputation and advertising is not a necessary component for an establishment of this caliber. i initially became interested after looking more into frances cuisine outposts here in boston and lespaliers experience took the cake according to countless other reviewers.lespalier is a full service dining experience,  meaning everything from the moment you step in the door to the moment you leave, every minute is a curated part of this food journey. upon entrance, youll take an elevator up to the restaurant where, depending on the time or season, youll be sat in one of the restaurants styled and themed upper scale dining rooms. service is immediate and theres never a moment of waiting. the server was knowledgeable alongside the servers assistant who both showed the expertise and professionalism required for a position like this.prixfix is the recommendation here and the restaurant suggests it for the entire table should one person get it to ensure a streamlined experience. from perfectly cooked meats to cheeses that serve to compliment every course of this meal, everything here about the food is as good as it possibly can get. everything here about the experience is memorable and leaves a lasting impression of a meal that is not in any way unimaginable or regular.such a dining experience is certainly not cheap and lespalier is a lunch or dinner to remember for a lifetime. should you decide to go, make it a special occasion and dress the part. your experience will be unparalleled."

Mastro's Ocean Club,5,it was just an amazing moment. i had a blast. and i was laughing a lot... i never seen a restaurant like that. we didnt know the concept before going to that place. all about the waiter hard talking and the funny hat. just looking at other persons was really funny. i was the retired stripper and it was a magic moment. i really love that margarita and the food. you have to try ! be open minded and keep in mind nothing is personnal.
Boston Sports Grille,3,gourmet burgers might sound oxymoronic! but not at this joint. they have perfected a great receipe! you just have to try it for yourself!

Umai,5,convenient and priceable
Dunkin',3,i just went to max noodle and i would suggest not anyone go there! i asked for a togo container for my leftover soup and they argue with me that i would have to put it in the box in that they do not offer togo containers for soup however they have them behind the counter and i asked for one. the lady then began to yell at me that they do not give out to go containers for soup. she then argued with me as i attempted to box up my soup and spilled it all over the table as the liquid would not fit into the box. the food was not even that great i would not suggest going there due to the hassle that i received.

PITA Restaurant,5,"the burgers are insane and so are the fries and so are the frappes, and everything was delicious. i just wish the frappe wasnt so extremely sweet enough to give me a headache after 2 sips and that it was more frozen. i also wish the nacho fries had some salsa instead of just chopped tomato, onion, etc. just keep in mind that this is a super indulgent place."
Snappy Sushi,5,"i liked it. the food was okay. our waiter was fantastic, but everyone else was weird, gross  the guy setting up the table had his hands all over the silverware and glasses where people put their mouths  or even a jerk  especially the guy downstairs when you first come in. i was really excited about going here, but for the price, it is not worth it."

Silvertone Bar & Grill,4,umm have you tried the crispy shrimp..... so amazing. best spot in the north end hands down.

ReelHouse,5,"we almost solely go here just for the pho. im not vietnamese so by no means do i claim to know traditional pho, but what i do know is good tasting pho and pho le is the number one place to get it. been to many restaurants and overall pho le is the only one that consistently delivers a delicious bowl with friendly staff that are great."
Acapulcos Mexican Family Restaurant & Cantina,5,"love the food. oysters, salmon toasts, ceviche, sea scallop crudo, roasted corn cake, lobster bisque, carrot cake, chocolate mousse, ive had all of the above and all were perfect. delicious, beautiful. all prepared right in front of you in their open kitchen. friendly service. tempted to give it four and not five stars because every time we have been it has been hard to carry on a conversation. its a small place with a lot of seats jammed in, so the noise level gets pretty high. the food trumps this defect however. we have eaten at most of the restaurants in the south end. you will drop a lot of money here but you will enjoy food you cant make at home in your wildest dreams. and, in the warm weather, you can sit outside on their cozy patio."
New China,5,"terrific, bright, cheery decor. banging, fresh street tacos with hearty portions and lots of variety on their menu. i was a first time customer last weekend and ill be back!"
Cappy's Pizza & Subs,5,awesome sushi! a must visit if youre in town for a show.
Salvatore's,4,"casa is the top lunch spot for take away if youre near post office square.  it has all your normal italian fare, made fresh while you wait.  wait times are about 1015 minutes for the food, and can be considerably longer depending on the line.  easily the best lunch youre going to get for italian for a great price."

Hard Rock Cafe,3,"the best mexican food. i never get tired of this restaurant. the amount of food is always too much i never get to eat it all, i always have to take home. the margaritas are a bomb, if you  are not a drinker, dont ever drink more than one. the servers are great and the guacamole is always delicious and serve fresh at your table. a bit pricey but for all the food, great drinks and a great service,  you cant ask for more."
Stella Restaurant,1,"we went to tavern in the square before a celtics game. we went to banners first  which was insanely busy and impossible to get a table they just laughed. tits was such a better experience. the bar was easy, we got a table in short order, and food was really good. plus the service was amazing! our server tom made the night birthday celebration  he was probably the best server ive had in a really long time. super nice and attentive.well definitely be back before a bs or cs game!"

Greenhills Irish Bakery,4,the food is amazing!  however the servers try too hard. i dont need them to tell me i cleaned the plate with the lame you didnt like that joke. i can stay home and listen to my son tell bad jokes.

JAK PIZZERIA,5,"go here at least once a month for fried chicken mainly because wings over you have to order then wait a while and the nearest kfc is across town. chicken is good and their mild favor...... oh i mean spicy yeah right... it has a barest amount of heat if it just came outta the frier but if you want more, ask for as much hot sauce as you can get.place is clean and presentable yet the only issue i have is sometimes waiting more than 10 minutes for chicken as they are in the process of cooking more. understandable to me as im typically a passionate person a will wait without issue but if there are seven or more people working that day, at least one person shouldve noticed the chicken amount getting low and begin cooking more."
Pastoral ARTisan Pizza + Kitchen + Bar,5,it oky
New Sushi Inc,4,"i have been searching a good vegeterian thai restaurant for a long time and my search ends here. it is the best vegan restaurant for thai cuisine. i tried a soup and an entree and they were more than enough for my stomach to be full until next morning. the taste is superb and the veggie meat they serve is also very good taste wise. they substitute the meat with a vegeterian ingredient and it suits the dish as well. it is very filling and also 1 thing to remember the restaurant is on the 2nd floor, it was a little difficult for me to find out."

Boston Market,1,the steak and eggs along with the bloody marys make for an excellent sunday brunch to nurse your hangover or just satiate your hunger. most of the other dishes burgers and fries are fairly good but not the best in class. it does get crowded on sundays so id call ahead to see if they can seat your party.

Dates and Olives,1,"lovely atmosphere for afternoon tea and great service! my partner in crime enjoyed the experience as much as i did, where the scones, desserts, and tea sandwiches were savored as we sipped the quality tea. we had gone to mem tea imports before and enjoyed their tea, and it didnt disappoint in this setting. the waiters explained when they served the tea and snacks, and refilled our teapots as needed. the only complaint that we might have is that the price is steep compared to other places weve been to for afternoon tea for just what you get, but still lovely. would go again if the opportunity arises."
Yoki Express - Ramen & Poke Bowls,3,"i have been coming to this restaurant since i was a kid. honestly speaking, i think that the quality of food has gone down over the years. however, i think it reflects the location. since there are less asians coming here the restaurant has started to cater more towards americans. i still think that the food is delicious and worth the money. the staff here are nice and overall the environment is welcoming. for chinese restaurant, i would say that this place is clean. they also have large variety of foods and they are open all day and night. in the mornings, you can get dim sum. on saturdays and sundays there are large crowds but since the restaurant is so spacious they can accommodate a lot of people. they also have a dinner menu which is more banquetstyle. instead of having carts world around you order from a menu. overall, i would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try dim sum and other delicious chinese food."
Kantin,3,great restaurant in the area
Davio's Northern Italian Steakhouse,4,"the food is pretty hit or miss, but the service is consistently poor. it took ages for us to be waited on and we didnt even receive any water until we asked for the fourth time even then, only half the table was served some. as for the food, like i said, its pretty hit or miss. theres loads on the menu, so i havent even come close to trying it all, but so far, my favourite item is the scallion pancakes. other than that, ive found most items to be too salty for my taste. still, its a good place to go when a late night dumpling craving strikes"

Halal Indian Cuisine,4,"the service here is bad.. i mean like bad, bad.. the front couter service was too busy talking with friends and ignoring customers at the counter, and while i was waiting a customer from drive thru came in to complain about getting the wrong food and the manager basicly just gave her free food to shut her up. probably wont be going back.."
Krazy Jakes,4,"nachos and salsa were tasty but meal was not great, i had some beef fajitas which were just odd and the cheese was off putting. disappointing after so many other great meals on the area."
Dumpling Cafe,3,good but pricey and you dont leave feeling full. also they should really use real butter instead of margarine. it would make a huge difference in taste.

Restaurante Cesaria,5,"great little vietnamese place in the hong kong market food court. their bahn mi is a classic and the best in town. their coconut curry soup is also pretty bomb. its too bad the food court is such an unpleasant place to eat, always hot in the summer and freezing in the winter and with very cheap uncomfortable furniture."
Assaggio,5,"ill preface the review with the fact that we came on a sunday night at 9pm, but did have a reservation.the 2 stars are for service and atmosphere. our water glasses were always full and the upstairs is cute and romantic.my husband and i each had a starter, entree, and dessert and each was a miss. his salad was drenched in balsamic vinegar and mostly stems, my beef carpaccio was covered in what tasted like straight mayonnaise, his steak frites was cooked well when he requested medium rare, my beef wellington was hard to cut, hard to chew, and soggy with poor quality foie gras, my lava cake had no lava and the ice cream had chunks of ice and frozen bits of fat, and his truffles were old and lacked flavor.the pinot bottle that we ordered was a punch in the face as well. we expect a cheaper wine from a restaurant to still be drinkable. overall a dissapointment and also doubly dissapointed because its really not french cuisine."

Locale,4,great place to eat during lunch break.
Taco Bell,5,"the slowest taco bell in existence, prepare to wait! after waiting for half an hour and getting my name yelled 3 times and me going up to the counter and being told to wait more, i got some of the food that i ordered. there was one employee who was helpful apparently it was her first day but she clearly knew more than all of the other employees combined but i couldnt believe how the staff could not make food in a queue style. in addition to not receiving some of my items, food came with substitutions without us being notified. luckily we did not have any food allergies but if we did i would be sending a one star review.would not recommend this place in its current state, but the restaurant itself is very clean and nice and if the staff were overhauled or trained on how to work at taco bell this place would be amazing.to be fair, we did go in 15 minutes before it closed, but i would think that would make it even easier to make our order by no means is it rush hour for taco bell 15 minutes before closing. i have been here during lunchtime where its packed and it is the same experience but worse somehow."
Tip Tap Room,5,we never got our table even thought we had a reservation! our reservation was at 730pm and we arrived on time. they checked us in and told us to wait for 1520 mins. there were a bunch of people crowed in front of the entrance already. we waited till 745pm and decided to leave. we finally received their call for our table at 815pm while we were eating at another restaurant. our friends has the same situation on that night  his reservation was 7pm but he got his table around 745pm. no food reviews cuz we didnt even get a table

Boston Kebab House,5,"while the staff was super friendly the first thing that hits you when walking in, is the smell of garbage. the scallion cakes, chicken wings, spring rolls were good but the mongolian beef dish was rubbery and tough. perhaps i came on the wrong day......"
Eataly Boston,5,"my food was cold and tough, it was a very crowded night but i feel visting the north end you should get a meal that says so. my chicken was so thin it might as well just been breading. honestly was very tv dinner like nothing about that meal seemed made in house...not impressed for the price we paid."

Al's State Street Cafe,5,"editing my review after a recent incident at this place.cheap, disgusting, very aggressive waitress one in particular, worthless owner.if i had the ability to rate this place 0 or even negative  stars, i would do that.first i used to like to go this place, as they at least had some decent food before, now they dont even have that.secondly, the reason behind this very bad review is a recent incident, when i went for buffet. the food was not at all above average and the service was definitely not good. i did not like the behavior at all and that is why i did not find any reason to add any single penny of tip. the waitress who actually did not serve us at all or even showed us a table called us in and said we forgot to add tip, when i said that i did not add it because i did not like the service, she was so furious and became aggressive to us and literally demanded for tip, which was a little shocking and unbelievable to me on top of this, the owner was actually supporting her and did not say a single word to her but asked me to paygive tip to her. i took out my wallet and gave almost all the cash i had there. she shamelessly put all of them and went inside that was actually unbelievable act from a person who i assume would be a student. i expected at least a sense of respect from the owner or that shameless waitress to their customers which was missing big time in them.an advice to owner pay your waitressworkers at least that much that they wouldnt have to begfightdemandbecome aggressive for tips.an advice to the waitress get yourself some self respect and earn the tip rather than demanding or begging for it."
B&G Oysters,5,"when you enter the restaurant, your first impulse might be to run away from the extreme noise inside. fortunately, you get used to the rumpus and also, this is the only downside of the place.the service is blazing fast, nothing short of incredible! we were served one rice dish, one salad, french fries and two main courses in under 10 minutes. everyone from the staff moves quickly between the tables, and you get your glass of water refilled regularly.the food itself is quite delicious. if you wonder what to order, the restaurants favorite meals are marked in the menu to make it easier for you. try the fried kimchi rice which is a little hot, but just right and the wutang tiger style ribs  both are great."
Boston Chowda Co,5,"good food, nice service staff."
Erbaluce,5,"no complaints here. its a nice open dining space and very respectful service. amazing food too, one of the best sit down asian cuisine restaurants around."

Tavitas Mexican,5,"maybe i didnt order the best plate, but their kung pao chicken was incredibly awful  especially the chicken the veggies were fine compared to it. it tasted like it had gone bad the night before.but considering how popular it seemed, i might give it one last try before i mark it as a no."

Larry J's BBQ Cafe,1,"a cool spot for boston standards as a small japanese inspired room at the back of a tiki bar. excellent quality fish and rice, and a very knowledgeable somm. the music was a bit quiet and because of that it was a very intimate experience, only things missing were a wow factor in the food and experience, this was a traditional sushi dinner with high quality ingredients. the only unique dish was a boston inspired miso soup to complete the meal, but it left you wanting more."
Chinatown Cafe,5,there are much better places in the north end

Black Seed Cafe & Grill,5,always have a good experience with the food
McDonald's,1,food was ok. definitely over priced for what you get. only been once and thats the last i think. they like to let you stand there like a jackass wondering if youre supposed to sit down or wait for someone until a man who doesnt speak english or talk well at all mumbles something and points to a menu on the wall. i also am not a fan of hair in my food.
Little Caesars Pizza,5,this restaurant chain is family friendly and the food is excellent. always has good servers. good place to take children as well.

Bin 26 Enoteca,3,bk is bk. we all know that it is not truly healthy.
Italian Express Pizzeria,5,"it is very difficult to rate an establishment like this. they are clearly in a popular sports area and make their living off of red sox games. i have never eaten here so i cant speak to the food although when i stopped in today after the game the food was coming out of the kitchen and everybody seemed very happy. what i like about the bleacher bar is many times i bring business associates from out of town who have never seen fenway park to the bleacher bar and they get an upclose look right from the left field warning track and are blown away that a place like this exists. i will say that every time i have been there, which is maybe 1015 times, the service has always been good the servers are always very friendly like i said before i have never tried the food. i stopped in today after the red sox game just to kill some time to let the crowds thin out before i got on the green line and the bartenders today were spectacular they made eye contact with every person coming through that door and nobody waited more than a minute or two for a drink. for what they do and how they do it i give them 5 stars"

Fleming’s Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar,5,"sweetgreen is one of my togo places. you can count on it to have healthy food that tastes very good. i enjoy their preset meals, but my favorite is making your own salad. these tend to be very good if you like customization.salad taste in general  55. if you can make healthy food taste good, i like itbread  45 . bread can present on the stale side occasionally."
Sal's Pizza,2,"if you can get a seat upstairs, i guess this place wouldnt be so bad. this was my first time here, so i paid an arm and a leg not realizing that and i could barely see the stage from the standing room area. food and drinks are pretty overpriced as well. staff was nice though and i cant complain about the acoustics."

Tony's Pizza and Restaurant,4,today this location did not open their doors until 615am. when their store hours are 6am. a host of people came through to tug at the doors and went down to the dunkin donuts instead. this has become a habitual issue for this location running behindin the mornings. some of us make a stop here each morning and puts us behind on what we have to do. friendly staff decent service but they need to work on opening on time

Franco's Trattoria,5,"cheerful and friendly staff. very clean and cozy establishment. diverse and flavorful menu of both food stuff and drinkables. our food was ready quick and easily beat expectations. the pizzas looked small, but holy smokes were they delicious and filling. the big show stopper for me however was most definitely the onion rings... thick crispy batter, and onions that melted in my mouth. even if you dont like pizza, go here for these onion rings. great place, check it out already."

Boston Market,5,"good food, though tough for people with allergies. the manager came over and spoke directly with us and told us that they can not even reccomend most of the menu as allergy safe. the honesty was greatly appreciated however and the better safe than sorry approach was a refreshing experience from a ramen shop as opposed to just brushing it off."
Falafel King,4,"breakfast at krazy jakes. we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated, which was fine. seated comfortably, not cramped in like a lot of other breakfast places. i ordered the crab cakes benedict which was a bit disappointing. the crab cakes were heavy on the cut up pepper, but worst of all my eggs were overdone. my husband got the irish benedict and his eggs were also over done. i also ordered a heated corn muffin and that was good."

Chinese Dragon,5,"not all franchises are created equal. its still a popeyes, but this location is frequently understaffed or incompetently staffed, resulting in long wait times and order mistakes. each time i have visited, i have left missing something upon checking the bag. last time it was an entire chicken tender combo, this time is was the biscuits with the family meal, and i received a frozen lemonade vs a regular drink. theyre extremely busy, and run out of things as a result. tonight there wasnt enough mild to complete a 16 piece combo, they were out of rice and you can absolutely forget about the sandwich. this location isnt an extreme distance, and id like to visit it more often, but it would be much appreciated if they cleaned their act up first"

Union Oyster House,1,"interesting place. crowded. awkwardly you are forced to sit at a table with total strangers. in my case it wasnt a good thing.  i was sat at a table with three other people. i tried to get conversation started a couple of times but the others were not into it. foodwise, it was difficult to order, too many options and the menu does not have a lot of pictures. i ordered sliced szechuan chicken. lots of food and it was good tasting. it was hard to eat though because it was extremely hot temperaturewise. i thought it was a bit overpriced. almost 20 for a bowl of food. i have mixed feelings. i dont think i am coming back."

Fasika Cafe,5,ive had nothing but positive experiences ordering from mike  pattys over the last few years!i usually get the baller or grilled crack with avocado as pictured below.wait time varies a bit as the weekends are their busiest time. the front door can be a bit hectic so just be patient.i recommend ordering ahead via their website for the best price.definitely add avocado as its always fresh and delicious.prices are above average for most of their items but the flavor and convenience make up for it.

Chilli Thai Bistro,4,"i love chinese food, but sadly yum mee doesnt do it for me. the fingers were batterheavy, the lo mein wasnt flavorful, and the orange chicken i got lacked the citrus flavor and seemed a lot like tgi fridays frozen bbq chicken bites or something.the rangoons and beef teriyaki were good, but the rangoons suffered from what looked to be a homemade duc sauce that had a grainy taste and feel like old honey that made me feel a little sick afterwards"

Bon Me,5,"i might go here about once or twice a month. the staff tries really hard, but gets absolutely slammed with all the office workers around. the customers get snippy, but the line moves pretty fast. just be aware that if youve decided to get coffee, about a dozen other people probably have as well."
Grainmaker,4,stopped for drinks. bartenders were attentive and inventive  worked hard to make a custom drink for a picky drinker.

Andre's Cafe,5,"my favorite goto place. acapulcos in norwood has friendly, attentive staff, a great selection of menu items, and a welcoming, comfortable atmosphere. i often stop by to have a late lunch or early dinner alone and am always greeted warmly. my favorites are the avocado salad with chicken, oceano burrito, or the acapulco burrito with pork. its a great place for families, coworkers, couples, or just me to have a relaxed, enjoyable meal with views of the golf course out the back window."

BEERWORKS (No. 3 Boston/Canal),5,"our second visit just as happy as the first time! we had a lovely evening of delicious and unexpected food, personal service, and wonderful conversation. of note on the menu the boston uncommon roll, o toro sushi, the chefs special roll, and the fried cheesecake. daily specials were also wellchosen. despite the business of the evening and several last minute requests for our reservations, we had no problem being seated. our server was prompt, efficient, and friendly her suggestions for dessert were impeccable. we spent the evening talking and laughing easily. saturday evening or not, the ambiance was calm enough for conversation."

Yellow Door Taqueria,5,delicious food...nice patio...great service.
Wollaston's Market,4,"fantastic food, drinks, ambiance and service. this is one of my favorite spots in boston. weve been hundreds of times but for my birthday last year, our server surprised us with a custom charcuterie board,  complimentary birthday toast with signature champagne cocktails, and even hooked us up with a bone marrow luge!! ask about it, its a fantastic experience."
Pat's Place,5,wonderful food and service. it is a must for sundays brunch
Herrera's Mexican Grill,4,"this was my second trip to the gallows, and i was pleased. the drinks were all quite good we had a few, and the poutine was as delicious as i remembered. the real highlight, however, was the gnocchi, which was served with mushrooms and green beans in a delicious sauce. i was a bit disappointed by the lack of food options on the menu though, which is half sandwiches and half entrees. the other item we tried was the falafel burger, which was good but over salted in combination with the feta. also, the fries that came with the sandwich were a bit disappointing since they are essentially a less interesting version of the poutine which everyone seems to order and did not provide any break from the amount of salt in the sandwich.that being said, the gnocchi and drinks alone made the meal a satisfying one."
Granary Tavern,3,"pricy lobster roll but totally worth it. came from nyc all the way to try it. so you should too.the lobster was quite fresh, but for that price, i dont know if it is actually a worthit winner."
Bleacher Bar,5,"great steaks as well as a  cozy, clean, and warm atmosphere."
Little Caesars Pizza,4,"a great place to go for brunch!  their delicious breakfast options, unique drinks and relaxing outdoor patio created a wonderful experience for us!"

The Gallows,5,favorite place for breakfast during the work week downtown. great gyros at lunch too!

Phở Pasteur,3,"waitresses are tentive, great foods and drinks."
Bullfinchs,5,good food but pricey. you pay for the waterfront view.
Gourmet Dumpling House,4,"a little on the pricey side, but worth it. my group split some calamari, fries and oysters while waiting for another event nearby. you dont think of fries as anything special until they are crisp, fresh and lightly seasoned. and the calamari was perfectly cooked and served with an awesome pepper aioli. the oysters were super fresh and served with a zingy cocktail sauce. one of our group had something off the sandwich menu forget which and dropped out of the conversation until it was finished, he enjoyed it so thoroughly. eastern standard also boasts a vibrant, seasonallyevolving drink menu to match their delicious food options. rum fans, try the opposition while you can. rumforward, pimento bitters adds some flash, caramel simple syrup takes the edge off, and crushed lime peel rubbed on the rim brightens it up."
Al Dente Ristorante,2,came here for dessert. the service is so underwhelming. the staff is on his phone playing video games while tables are dirty. we for the mooochi fruit. it was okay and pricy at 9 something. probably wont be back because of the underwhelming experience
Venezia Restaurant Boston,4,"nice place for a quick bite, for a family or group of friends. burgers are bit overated but definitely above average. jenns chicken sandwich or salad is good as well.make sure to order their delicious tater tots with your meal "

The Pizza Shuttle,5,"our family love this place because i brought my wife to this place when we first met and two kids later we still go to this restaurant every time we are in boston chinatown. we love their food and their service. the wait staff know what we like to drink and what like to eat. my oldest son who is 11 loves their desert in addition to his usual pan fried noodle, while we love our usual clams on black bean sauce, pea pod stem with garlic, house special fried rice, steamed fish on ginger and scallion and soy sauce or twin lobsters with ginger, or seafood in xo sauce,  and spicy salt calamari."
Casa Romero,5,"i know legal has a good reputation in boston, but i continue to find it merely ok at best. i struggle to find something basic like, please stop adding quinoa to things no one wants that in their seafood, and the simple, classic dishes are not very well done.  the fish and chips at whole foods for 13 is fresher and more delicious than the one here that costs 24. the rolls are the best things at this tourist trap."
Cappy's Pizza & Subs,4,"prime rib was absolutely delicious, melt in your mouth! the chocolate cake was enormous enough for 4 people and a perfect way to end a fabulous meal. the decor was very stylish as well"
The Meatball Kitchen,4,best mexican food in the area.

China Taste,4,"delicious french food, and great customer service and romantic atmosphere!"
Amsterdam Falafelshop,5,"the service was sorely lacking. went for a scheduled, so they knew about it college football game watching event. they had a total of 2 wait staff and bartenders, less than half of their drafts were working, and they werent serving a full menu of bottlescans. the food is overpriced for the quality. would not recommend."
Gourmet India,5,delicious food and fun drinks. the adult capri suns are awesome!
Green Express,5,great wings and a truly great place to chill.
Riccardo's Ristorante,4,"beautiful place, they have plenty of out door seating. seafood was beyond fresh and tasty. theyre heirloom tomato  watermelon salad was probably one of the best salads ive ever had. kate our server was super friendly and chatted with us made us feel so welcomed. they also have a chocolate mouse that is to die for. im not a mousse person but this was so thick and rich and not overly sweet it had toffee bits and sea salt on top. our entire experience was amazing, and so happy we decided to eat here. this is a must eat in the south end.ac"

Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,"i went to the hideout this weekend after seeing a band i have seen and liked before was playing a gig. this lower level bar is a welcome relief from all the tourists traps nearby. it is definitely more a dive bar, with a hometown feel. good deals on beers and they offer free popcorn. we opted to leave to go to some more lively spots but i would go back here for a casual night out."

Galleria Umberto,4,"its fast food and its open late. what else is there to say. its he best of the bunch, but youll probably still come to regret it at some point in the evening."
Grainmaker,5,patio is delightful and service post covid is spot on. margaritas were more like limeaid or pink lemonade than anything enjoyable. tacos are under seasoned and over priced with fancy ingredients you cant really taste to justify the exhorbant taco prices.

Society on High,5,cost to much money
China Gourmet Restaurant,5,great drinks main courses and pizza.
Taco Bell,1,"spur of the moment restaurant choice just due to the proximity to park st. t station. good thing i wasnt voracious when i got there, however with the amount of time i waited for food, it quickly turned into disappointment.my friend ordered a lamb sandwich and received his order within minutes. i realized after 5 minutes of waiting that i should have ordered something else besides the chicken plate for 11. ugh after i placed my order the guy behind the register did not give me any warning, which i would have appreciated that it would take forever 25 minutes. there were about 4 people total in the restaurant. unfortunately i had to check with them multiple times and he seemed extremely disinterested. when i finally received my food it was only ok and my friend had already finished his sandwiches.these mediterranean  falafel places are seriously a dime a dozen in boston, you have plenty of other options. bonapita, shawarma falafel, etc..."

Marliave,3,going here for years awesome place for late night food .
West End Pizza,5,on fridays they have a three course menu for 19 and it is completely worth it. their spicy fried mozzarella balls is a great appetizer. highly recommend their pepperoni pizza. for dessert go for the tiramisu or the chocolate gelato.

Lucca Back Bay,5,"been going here practically my whole life. celebrated my birthday here on a saturday night with a party of 14 and literally everything was perfect. food, drinks, service...everything. because its further down hanover its just a little bit less hectic and more personal, and they knock it out of the park."

Supreme Pizza,3,"never knew they accepted my priority pass membership for lounge access. they credited me 28 on my receipt. unfortunately, after august 1st they will no longer accept priority pass membership. also, dont forget to tip you server for the full amount and not the discount. the food, if you follow me you can tell i eat allot of salad. i had the greek salad with lobster. all ingredients were cold and freash.  i will definitely stop again regardless of the priority. staff was exceptionally friendly. almost forgot they have a really cool bloody mary menu at each table. see attach photo."
"The White Bull Tavern | Boston's Best Comedy, Nightclub, Restaurant",4,just went and they messed up my whole order. did not realize until i got home. had to go all the way back.
Cappy's Pizza & Subs,5,so nice.
Yamato Hibachi & Sushi Bar,4,"you can tell they are trying to be mediocrethe hummus and tabouli salad was almost passable.  but the falafel, the star of the show, was awful. it was dry and tough, going through the mouth like pieces of hard dried oatmeal. the worst falafel ive ever had in my life.they also claimed the store had permanently closed online, to avoid bad reviews."
Trattoria Il Panino,4,a little to expensive for the food they serve. got an large italian and it came with very little meat

Panza,4,one of my favorite places in chinatown.
Maxs Deli Cafe,5,"i live next door to these guys and since theyve opened have basically stopped getting thai or vietnamese anywhere else in the city. sure, there are good examples of both cuisines elsewhere, but the folks at pho basil are extraordinarily attentive and fast. excellent food, always with a variety of specials, comes piping hot out of the kitchen mere minutes after you order, no matter how busy they are. their lunch combo is one of the best lunch deals in the area 2 added to a 7 entree gets you a soup, salad, and a few appetizer bites, and delivery and takeout is always great. definitely get some of the funkier pho dishes that you dont recognize from other menus, and the sparkling limeade is a perfect foil to the spice in your food."
Burro Bar South End,5,tasty!!!!!
99 Restaurants,5,"brunch here was ok, but nothing spectacular. i was glad that they had cold brew on the menu because it was a warm day, but my huevos rancheros came with a fried egg i was expecting scrambled, the blt came with pork belly which is very different than bacon, and nothing on the menu was that inspiring. service was great and it was a good location, but there are better places nearby."
Ozone,4,great salad
Montien Thai Restaurant,4,"the customer service here is very poor. you are rushed through the ordering process, any request you make like, i would like extra chicken please is met with the look, like i just asked to kill their first born. tried to order two bowls to bring one back for my co worker and it was like i asked them to solve world hunger.they dont portion very nicely, if i want extra chicken, i dont mean 1 full portion and then a half scoop. double meat is double portion. not 1.5. ordering guac and cheese from where i normally would order my rice and beans is also ridiculous. cant even see what i want on top and i have to shout across the line of people.2 stars for food as it was up to normal chipotle standards but  3 stars for the horrible experience. ill go to boloco next door instead, they are much nicer."
Raphael's Restaurant,5,on the expensive side. definitely not a 2 money sign. the food is solid.
Shojo,4,they put in double the order.

Fugakyu Cafe,5,best place for dinner before a bruins game. great burritos and guac.
Asian Garden Restaurant,5,house of blues has a lot of good shows. i have a gripe with the second floor though. if you end up on the second floor and dont go early you cant see the stage at all. so if youre going to go first and third floor only. the second is pretty risky.
The Living Room,4,"first time here. im not disappointed. if you like sushi, its the place."

Rosticeria Cancun,3,"for 7.50 i can guarentee as of this writing you are not going to get a more unique food experience. the entire ordering and cooking process up to the topping and getting your order is completely automated.  as a side note this company is using my companies control systems, how cool!  but as i was saying, its like being in the future with robots making your meal, and the best part is that the food is amazing! flavors are bold, but not over bearing and they have healthy clean options for every menu item!if you are in boston, you got to try spyce!"
La Famiglia Giorgio's Restaurant,5,was not happy...food cold and dried out...plus no crab legs evening
Nico Ristorante,2,average quality for the price. rissotto overcooked.

Honga,5,"the pasta was superb. went for all you can eat monday. you get to try 6 pastas with unlimited bread and salad. everything was divine and inventive. we sampled the whole menu and went back to our favorite so we had 4 bowls of pasta each with 2 servings of salad and cant wait to go back. the chef came out to introduce himself and was so humble and pleasant. the service was attentive and we had a beautiful dinner al fresco on a monday. go, go, go!"

Liberty Diner,5,"this is a very good restaurant, located within a sea of excellent restaurants in the north end of boston. the portions are reasonable, the food has a little more of that heavy, oldfashioned heartiness to it that some places have given up on for new wave mediterranean type food.if you want a filling meal at a reasonable price, and very good service, this is definitely worth a stop. plus you dont have to walk too far into the north end to get here if youre coming from downtown."
PikaloX,4,fairly expensive but the food is good. can sometimes be a bit crowded.

RED WHITE BUDDHA RAMEN,5,"great service  no fault to the staff whatsoever. food was average at best lackluster steak, questionable salmon. there were also two mice strutting around on the patio like mick jagger all night. beer selection was an afterthought a bunch of faux microbrews goose, shocktop, etc."

Coda,5,great views and lovely restaurant

Burtons Grill & Bar of Shrewsbury,1,"good value, good flavor"
Hard Rock Cafe,5,"i havent been here in at least 30 years, when i was a kid with my parents and dont really remember what i had. this time, i was disappointed. i had the broiled scallops. they were fresh and the portion was above average for the price, probably 1215 rather than 45 you get at most places but, when they say broiled scallops, thats what they mean. they were broiled scallops, and thats all. not a dash of salt  pepper, no bread crumbs, garlic, herb or spice of any kind, just broiled scallops with a little oil or butter and a wedge of lemon. the rice pilaf served with it was definitely not any pilaf ive ever had. it looked and tasted like nothing more than a scoop of uncle bens, flavorless white rice. it also came with some cole slaw, nothing special.my colleague had the fried scallops. they were definitely imported, probably from asia,   processed and frozen someplace else. the same unremarkable frozen scallops you would get at any local pizza shop. the ambiance was like a grungy old diner where the fishermen would go for lunch, except probably too expensive for fisherman. the service could have been a little more expedient and attentive as well. i would have liked another wedge of lemon but the server never came back after delivering the food. we also had to flag her down after a long wait after finishing to get the check.overall, it was just okay. i wouldnt make it a point to go back. but, who knows, maybe in another 30 years?"

Bertucci's Italian Restaurant,5,"we have had many good things to eat from metzys but do not get the fajitas, especially the veggie ones. the street corn and the pork belly is great and many of the tacos are my wifes favorites but i made the mistake of paying 14 for onions tonight. i ordered veggie fajitas and asked for no peppers. when we got the order home it was just grilled onions. i completely understand i went to a taco and burrito place and got fajitas and i should just shut up since i took the risk. if you are looking for vegetarian food i would suggest looking at one of the other mexican restaurants in the area who know there are more options when it comes to vegetables, el tapatio is very good."

"Explorateur Cafe, Restaurant & Bar",5,the best...
Galleria Umberto,5,"translated by google service was insanely slow. it took 20 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them. and when we were ready to settle up it took another 20 minutes to just flag down another waiter to be able to get our bill and even then it took forever to have them bring the machine over so we could pay.translated by googlethe service was insanely slow. it took 20 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them. and when we were ready to settle it took another 20 minutes to report another waiter so we could get our bill, and even then it took forever to get them to pick up the machine so we could pay.originalservice was insanely slow. it took 20 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered them. and when we were ready to settle up it took another 20 minutes to just flag down another waiter to be able to get our bill and even then it took forever to have them bring the machine over so we could pay.  google   .   20       .       20                           ."

49 Social,4,"very cool place with spectacular views of boston. food was disappointing though. i had a burrata with tomato, a ceasars salad, the salmon and the creme brulee. everything was average."
906 Homwin Chinese Restaurant,5,one of the worst restaurants i have been to. went there even after reading the mixed yelp reviews we thought it couldnt be that bad. trust me if you love thai food this place is not for you. the food was one of the worst thai food i have ever had. i dont want to even call it thai food. i am vegan and usually always support vegan establishments because i support what they stand for but i will advise you to stay away from this restaurant. we went there and ordered the tom kha soup one with tofu and one with the vegan chicken. when it came out it tasted like they just dumped a can of coconut milk in some vegetables and brought it out. it was so sweet it tasted like a dessert nothing like tom kha there was no usual thai spices. we couldnt even bring ourselves to drink two tablespoons of it and left it. our main meal came out which was pad thai with tofu and a curry vegan shrimp with tofu in an actual coconut cannot remember the name of this dish my goodness how could somewhere that claims to be authentic thai food mess up pad thai. it tasted like plain noodles my husbands coconut dish tasted like nothing. both dishes were so bland absolutely zero taste. the meals came out extremely fast so i knew they were not marinated well. i have had vegan pad thai before but this was not even near what the dish is suppose to taste like. of course we left back all four meals. the worst part of the experience was when my husband went to speak to the manager or owner and waitress about the meals they were so rude. my husband said that he would pay 50 of the meal even though we left back all of the food and barely touched it. the manager insisted that he paid 100 of the meals. when my husband said it was unfair because we didnt eat the meals they became even more rude to him. the manager asked him how much he wanted to pay and my husband indicated he would pay 50 they told him no he had to pay 60 of the bill my husband just to get out of that place he agreed. the owner or manager and waitress then starts to tell him to get out how he has no money to use here and he came here with no money and to get out and dont ever come back that we were not welcome here ever again as such we left. this place is absolutely a disgusting establishment and i will not advise anyone to patronize them. i am sorry to have to write such a bad review for a vegan restaurant but save your money. if i could give this place zero i would.
Top of the Hub,5,great distancing
Compari's Banquet Facility,5,"outstanding!  delicious, fresh italian restaurant from the bread to the fettuccine to the veal chops!"

6B Lounge,4,"translated by google cheers bostongrand hyatt taipei has a small bar called cheers, but the worlds most famous cheers should be nonboston. this 70sstyle traditional american pub, opened in 1969, is why it is so famous. what? because the filmmakers in the american film history have won the emmy award for up to 117 records, the cheers is based on this appearance, so boston can see souvenirs such as the mug tshirts that sell the cheers logo. street vendors, but the tv series only looks at the appearance here, the interior is completely different, so dont expect too much originalcheers bostongrand hyatt taipeicheerscheers70pub1969117cheerscheerst"
Cósmica,3,"i came here because a friend recommended it to me and her experience was great, but that was not my case.the service was terrible. i didnt even have a minute on my seat, and the waitress came twice to check if i was done with my order  which i wasnt because i didnt have enough time to read the menu. one minute after she came again and i ordered only one thing because she took the menu out of my hands! the place wasnt even full, there were some tables empty and this woman was in a hurry. also, when she brought my glass of water, napkins and stuff, she put them two seats away, not even close to me and i was the only person in that table. beside that, i was asking for chopsticks because they only gave me a fork, but they were not paying attention to my request.after all that, the only thing i wanted was leaving the place buuut due to the tastiness of the dumplings, i was going to order something else because the food was really good. but guess what?? i hadnt even finished my plate and this woman came and brought me the check. i paid and left.i felt really uncomfortable with this womans behavior. i usually dont give bad reviews but if you keep treating costumers like that, sooner or later you wont have costumers at all."
Herrera's Mexican Grill,4,"food was really good, and portion sizes were large. they have two parts, one for sit down and one for a quick sandwich and drinks. worth checking out if youre in the south end and want a nicer brunch"
Club Café,4,unique brunch experience
University Grill & Pizza,3,i went on a saturday evening with three of my friends. it was a very crowded place and we had to wait for close to 20 minutes to get seated. the place was not very clean and the waiters refused to clean it. we used napkins and cleaned it ourselves. the food we ordered arrived really fast but was sub par in quality. the fried rice was pretty well prepared but the soupy noodles didnt taste like it should. quantity is huge and you can definitely share it with two or three people.

The Capital Grille,5,if i were you i would not eat here... arrived about 1030pm on 5518 our server was linda she is an absolute sweetheart. but the cooks were  very rude and obnoxious yelling in the back tell them we only have salad and they better get to ordering! linda took our drink and food order and put them in we where kind of close to the kitchen but they were making it a point to speak loud enough for us to hear. they then had a five minute conversation about the movie waiting  and how the cooks did disgusting things to customers food. at that point i was not eating anything that came from the kitchen. linda came out with our order i told her i was not eating it and i would like to pay for our drinks and leave. she asked if it was because of the cooks and she understood and she was very apologetic. the manager came over and tried to assure us that nothing was done to our food but there is no way we would be able to enjoy that meal hearing what we heard. he did not seem to really care and allowed the cook to mock us as we walked out the door.
Sixth Gear - Cask & Kitchen,5,delicious pasta and chocolate cake
Artu,5,"note cash only!!note to self for next time dont overdo it if youre hungry.ive been meaning to stop by this place since its on the outskirts of chinatown and i drive by it fairly frequently but i finally decided that it was time to give another cantonese style bbq place a try and boy i was not disappointed!first off, parking is street parking only and can be a pain especially if you plan on eating in so keep that in mind.  there are metered spots so if you come during an off hour late lunch or early dinner you should be okay though make sure its not in a time frame where its resident parking only!.if youre unfamiliar with ordering and are intimidated lots of shouting in chinesecantonese dont worry as the cashier can speak english just fine!i opted for1 lb of roast pork0.5 lb of roast pork bellyseafood and vegetable over rice r26  7.75chicken soy sauce in wonton soup w3  8.75all of these items were absolutely fantastic!  the roast pork was super flavorful and contained enough fat to make is savory.  the seafood and vegetable was also large and yummy.  the chicken soy sauce wonton soup was far larger than expected which explains the price point as it had a good 14 lb of chicken in a large, deep bowl packed with noodles and a surprisngly ample amount of wontons that were also delicious id say at least 5 to 6 golf ball sized wontons.the amount for the 5 pounds of food i ordered was just shy of 40 which in my mind is totally worth it considering the size and flavor!service? what service?? its an authentic chinese restaurant so i wouldnt expect a smile just prompt service!definitely stop by if youre in the area!"
Marliave,4,food excellent music very loud
Bodega Canal,3,"fantastic food, creative and coupled with a great experience."

Crazy Dough's Pizza,3,"never had a bad time here.ownership and staff are always super friendly, and well qualified.menu is interesting enough to separate it from the basic boston bar menu, but nothing you havent heard of.  drink list gets updated a lot,  and the folks behind the bar are not afraid to go off menu.generally pretty lowkey vibe on most nights.  good spot for date night or dinner  drinks to catch up with friends. it will get crowded before  after fenway events, but manageable.also  one of the best places to be for the marathon.everyone should have a neighborhood bar this good."

Soup Shack JP,5,great sushi and yaki udon bowls. fair prices and attentive staff members. next to the historic state house! great experience.
Coppa Enoteca,4,worst indian food ever. we took 78 items and none of them were tasting good. we ended up wasting 90of what we ordered.
Sonsie,2,"whoever the fat manager was working tonight is so trashy and clearly uneducated. talking trash to other workers in a loud voice about others displays a lack of common sense and is very cowardly. also, the food comes out way too fast like its a fast food restaurant, so obviously its not fresh, and it tastes like it, too. this place has gone downhill over the years. the service is also inconsistent, too.  after my experience tonight, i wont be going back for sure.  there are many other options nearby.  its too bad as this used to be the place i used to really like."
P & R Restaurant,5,"i love this place. the food is good and very reasonably priced. depending on the season and weather, expect to wait in line outside between. summer is obviously a longer wait 30 minutes with better weather and lots of tourists, but ive also waited 10 minutes on a thursday at 5 in december.in my opinion, the line is worth it. start with a large calamari, caesar, and garlic bread and follow it with whatever protein, pasta, and sauce suits you. whatever you do, dont skip the calamari. i think it is the best thing they sell.the service is very very efficient. while it can come across as a little aggressive at first, you come to appreciate how well served you are. they clear shells, dirty plates, and refill your water before you even have a chance to notice. top notch!"

Semolina Kitchen + Bar,4,little bit of a wait guess they were busy with the drivethru dont go there very often for a burger and a fry for the price i choose to go and get a meatball chicken cutlet parm or a italian sub for the same price. for what they charge for one of there  meals.89 for chicken sandwich or a cheeseburger with fries that are usually overcooked or cold. i think its a healthier choice to hit the sub store. drivethru meals and only choices a burgers and thin little patties might find them quite expensive

Coach Grill,1,very good place for dessert and hot chocolate.
Taqueria Casa Real,5,great food nice ambience outstanding service by the wait staff. lousy parking plan! this restaurant is right downtown old boston. parking is hard to come by and expensive. but the restaurant advertises valet parking. hard to use hard to find and a lot of shrug shoulders when you try to discover where you should put your car where it is after you get out. sort of offputting.
Grill 23 & Bar,5,the margaritas are a high point and the food is pretty good but the wait was nuts. we waited for over 2 hours for a table and they would not give us a solid wait time until we were already there for an hour. i know that they didnt want to lose business but they should be more truthful to their clientele.
Terra at Eataly Boston,5,"great restaurant. love food, drinks and environment"

Pavement Coffeehouse,5,"wanting to try someplace new on a recent trip to boston, i walked to hard rock  faneuil hall. i havent eaten at a hard rock in years, so didnt know what to expect. it was crowded, so i was seated at the bar. service was slow, as the bartender seemed to feel he was extremely busy, yet the bar was far from full. i decided on the local legendary burger which, in boston, is topped with lobster meat. the burger was good, but nothing special, and not at all great for the price tag. i like the atmosphere, ok on the food, and really wanted more from the service. there are so many bostonoriginals nearby, i doubt ill return."
Herrera's Mexican Grill,1,very authentic hidden gem in the seaport. the restaurant was built in 1917 and it looks like not much was changed. the seafood is amazing and very authentic.

Top of the Hub,5,"theres really no other choice for brunch in rozzie. i went to sugar and it was fine, but one time i went back and found a long wait. after finding redds in rozzie on yelp i went there instead. the food is better and theres never been a wait when ive gone.their carolina brand of southern isnt my favorite i prefer texaslouisiana southern, but they execute nearly everything really well. i have yet to eat something there i didnt love. if you do get brunch, you must start off with one of their giant sticky buns. split it with someone. very worth it. wait staff can be on the slow side.i wish they were a little more affordable. but theyre very casual. and i wish i lived a little closer. they have a great bar, itd be a great place to walk to in the evening."
Venezia Restaurant Boston,1,"its fine but my delivery came cold  parking is limited. seems to be some menu confusion among staff. flavor is good but a bit greasy more ninja turtle style than crispy. its, like, totally ok."
Haymarket Pizza,5,"went because of the news on the lobster and waffle.  the bits of lobster fit on one quarter of the waffle which was quite good.  my daughters had the octopus empanada and the fried scallops, respectively.  they found both dishes to be excellent.  the cocktails were unusual and outstanding.  the service was good.  while the food was tasty and the ambience friendly, the seats were a horror.  the hard wooden benches were too high for a person of average heights feet to rest on the rail.  the seats also had a low arm that had to be maneuvered over to get in and out of the booth.  glad i went for the experience, but do not need another visit."
Panda Express,5,best bagels in jp
Sweet Cheeks Q,5,"we tried again because paani used to be our favorite restaurant.  we went there for birthdays and special occasions.  after our initial experiences in their sudbury location, see below  that rating was one star  we hadnt been back in over a year.  tonight we tried again takeout.  first the soup.   we had mulligatawny and the coconut tomato.  and what we had  of it it comes in 4oz quantities we could have done without.  unremarkable, salty, watery 1.50 per ounce.  i recommend skipping the experience.  considering that the  best mulligatawny i ever had was at paani years ago disappointing.the lamb samosas were lovely, crisp and  well seasoned.  if you have to be at panni, have these.  the railway goat curry had a nice flavor, but was very fatty, and what could be discerned of actual goat meat was very slight and overwhelmed by bones, gristle and fat.  nice flavor, but i dont feel better having eaten it.the chili mushroom appetizer  could have provided the oil for the whole meal.  the first taste was interesting, but the flavors were kind of odd and with the heaviness, i ended up not finishing it.  the naan  we had the onioncoriander one  was about what you would expect, also a little heavy and on the  doughy side.  all in all, not horrible, but also not a meal i would repeat.  upping my one star to two.from over a year ago i  have to agree with boris.  severely disappointed with my first experience at the new paani.  tonight we ordered takeout.  two of the 6 things we ordered were not right and the flavor was lacking in everything.  they substituted tandoori chicken for the chicken tikka we requested and paneer pakoras for the onion bhaji we ordered without any notification to us  neither had much flavor and both were rather dry.  also, i had looked forward to the soup i remembered from the old location.  tonights mulligatawny soup was too salty and simply not as flavorful as i had remembered.  the lamb samosas were dry and had no peas, or any vegetable.  the chicken tikka masala was okay, but not particularly good.  paani used to be our favorite indian place in all of the greater boston area.  not this paani."
Hong Kong Harbor,5,love love love. everything is good.
Luke's Lobster Downtown Crossing,1,"hello, bs owners! firstly, i want to say thank you for the delicious salads and quinoa bowls. i love coming here.i do wish to ask you to retitle one item on your menu. your korean bowl doesnt actually have any koreanspecific ingredients in it from what i can see. miso is from japan, and soy sauce has its primary origin from china. yes, soy sauce is widely used throughout asia, but hardly earns the dish the name of korean bowl. can you fix this, please? either change the name or change the recipe.ive spoken to the manager a couple times about this over the past half year, but the message doesnt seem to be getting through to the corporate offices."

Eire Pub,4,"tasty burger and i usually only met late at night, after a few drinks. it was that kind of a relationship. i normally try to limit my unhealthy food decisions, but sometimes i just couldnt resist tasty burger on my way home from the bars. these burgers are so delicious and theyre even more tasty as a drunken snack. their plain hamburgers are good, but they have great options like a hamburger with pineapple and bbq sauce or hamburgers with mushrooms and onion rings. they have a bar inside too, which makes it a great place to grab a drink before or after the red sox games. the place is always packed so you know they have to have some good burgers!"
Bleacher Bar,5,good pub. needs a little tlc with the food...

Domino's Pizza,5,"edit 1029 my crossiant is so burned that they may as well have thrown it onon the barbeque, the bacon was tough, the egg still cold, and the cheese isnt melted. like what the hell. i demand a resolutionedit 1028 this is the 5th time this month that the app doesnt work for dunkin. some of have to work and when there is 15 people in line from 7745 this is obsurd. no crowd control. i think its time for crowd control or make it so the dunkins is 12 hours not 24 hours only.1027 i do not appreciate seeing a manager talking negatively about her employees to customers in front of the employees. the manager herself should be kicked to the curb, she is rude, unprofessional, never allows her employees on register, or ever acts in a caring manner. she has a greedy mannered trait to her and she doesnt belong in dunkins brand stores. if shes always on register whos doing her filing, emails, percentages, and job as a manager.... clearly not her. a manager is supposed to be a book keeper in an officer and letting her employees do their job. she is too busy dropping personal problems on customers like a hs girl than doing her job. new.get her gone. now or i am calling the ceo"
Starbucks,4,"overall good place.clean  fresh.the only reason i deduct two stars is i called them to make a reservation and they did not take it and instead they told me just come in and the voice on the phone was really rude. when we arrived, the front desk receptionist made us wait for at least 5 minutes. we had one infant and other 3 years old kids. not good!"

New Sushi Inc,5,loved the lobster ravioli. great service. you will not leave hungry.
Friendly's,1,liked their friendly service and food was ok. the space is tiny and they need a good cook who can make authentic ethiopian food. they need to consider having gluten free options with the teff injera instead of one bread for all.
North Street Grille,5,"lets first start out by saying this is in the north end. im not sure you can find a bad restaurant in the north end! italian food is always one of my favorites. the italian food here is superb absolutely delicious, the bread is good. very nice unfortunately the service...... although theyre very nice , they are very very slow. i absolutely will be back id like to try everything on the menu"

Outlook Kitchen,5,amazing place for noodles. so many ways to customize your bowl and eat what you really want. everything is delicious and super healthy.
Newtowne Grille,1,their traditional taiyaki doesnt quite match up to authentic japanese taiyaki as its a little more doughy and can be left sitting for a while before being served but its still solidly delicious and the best option in the area. i havent tried their ice cream yet but am looking forward to giving it a shot.
Starbucks,4,food is mediocre. girls were cute.
House of Blues Boston,4,the food was good as well as the service and it wasnt that expensive... i only thing i didnt like was having to take an elevator down to use the restrooms. thats why a four star

The Q,5,"if you want low quality food, in a very dirty environment, this is the place for you.we ordered very basic food, and a beer, the beer came in a very dirty glass, and the beer taps havent been cleaned in a very long time. sam adams would probably stop delivering to this place if they knew how their product was being served.i ordered a turkey club wcheese on wheat.i got a turkey club on white no cheese.and the lettuce was the core, hard and white, which was weird, as we had got their at the breakfast lunch change over. bacon was burned, literally black burned.then i started looking around, ceiling tiles all stained from roof, or utility leaks, floors havent been washed in weeks, walls with food stains from who knows when. just a very disgusting and gross experience.. i wish their was better choices within a couple miles.. garrisons and the belly buster are way better options than this place, but their quality isnt a whole lot better avoid this place"
Boston Pizza & Seafood,2,"well despite it being so slow the ice cream was actually great. got a jim dandy and was pretty impressed.  what i did not like was the fact that for one it took about 20 minutes for 2 ice creams with barely anyone in line but secondly i seen one guy taking out the ice cream from a big tub and placing it into a smaller one, he had gloves but you could see he was getting it on his arms and making skin contact."
Sixth Gear - Cask & Kitchen,5,this place serves some tasty tapas style small plates and a great variety of cocktailsmixed drinks! the service was friendly and the atmosphere inside was much more exotic and stylish than the relatively plain exterior would suggest. the food is just a bit expensive for both the quality and quantity that is served but the menu they offer is quite unique so definitely still worth a try!

Lucia Ristorante,4,excellent brunch spot. interesting items on the menu. good drink selection too.
Bristol Restaurant and Bar,3,great lobster rolls
Taqueria y Pupuseria Mi Ranchito,1,same food every chinese buffet in the area serves. this place is much cleaner and staff is better than the buffet in chicopee. food is always edible but nothing that will impress you. price is fine for lunch but watch out at dinner time. for 2 people and a kid its same cost as a good restuarant.
Fill-A-Buster Luncheonette,4,"very nice place, good service and very friendly staffs."
City Bar Back Bay,3,"the chicken broccoli wziti that i ordered via mealpal was horrible. the pasta was dry, the chicken was chewy and the broccoli tasted stale. maybe it was the old leftovers they kept aside for mealpal customers."
Ba Lẹ Restaurant,5,"the food tasted quite delicious and sticks to its mediterranean cuisine, however it was served cold which wasnt very pleasant.manoush1. braised beef wrap  it has good quantity juicy beef with ample veggies and sauce2. zataar chicken wrap it was a very juicy and succulent zataar chicken with yummy coriander sauce what complimented well in the wrapsides3. baba ganoush with spiced lamb it was very creamy lamb mix, definitely recommended to try4. zataar chicken with couscous  it was topped with garlic sauce and pickled beetroot, which adds all the taste to the dish, otherwise its a quite mild tasting dishcocktails5. whiskey grapefruit it was made with ginger juice, which was unexpected and was kinda offputting for a cocktail the place has a beautiful ambiance and very kind and helpful staff."
Toro,5,the morningbreakfast crew messed up my order twice. the lunchnight crew are awesome though.
Table Boston,1,this location was unpleasant. tables were grimy and the floor around the drink station was wet and slippery. the restroom was also filthy. my chicken strips were dry and tasteless. i tossed them out.
Lolita Back Bay,5,friendly with good food and drink. the pricequality is in the middle
Tangierino Restaurant,4,"beautiful interior and fantastic hibachi show. however, the staff was unsure and unprepared with how to deal with a crowd 15ppl, with prior reservations our food took over 1.5 hours to come, and then it took over a half hour to get everyones check."

Nobo Japanese Restaurant,4,affordable breakfast options. lunch can get expensive. the salads while not very diverse are massive and a decent deal. the sandwiches are big but very expensive.
2TWENTY2,4,"you get what you pay for is the slogan for this place. fast service and large portions, but not then greatest food. the crab rangoon might as well be fried wontons because they are so empty. and the salt and pepper shrimp is a few shrimp with a ton of onions and peppers and far far too much black pepper. decent prices though. just stick with the regular pupu platter type items and youll do okay."
Canton House,5,cajun fries are the best!!!
Terra at Eataly Boston,4,i was so impressed with the customer service at this location.. they welcom you when u walk in.. acknowledgment feels good.. i pre ordered a family meal.. ot was all ready and still hot! the gentleman at the register was so friendly and nice.. he threw in a free rasberry lemonade.. my fav from boston market! thanks for an enjoyable visit..

Frenchie Wine Bistro,5,"got a spicy fried chicken sandwich meal and a strawberry lemonade slushie. the meal comes with a sandwich,  choice of side fries, mac salad, or cheesecake, and also cheese bread. when i got my order freshly made, the whole box inside the paper bag was covered with grease. also, i find it weird that they automatically package everything up to go rather got a spicy fried chicken sandwich meal and a strawberry lemonade slushie. the meal comes with a sandwich,  choice of side fries, mac salad, or cheesecake, and also cheese bread. when i got my order freshly made, the whole box inside the paper bag was covered with grease. also, i find it weird that they automatically package everything up to go rather than putting it out on a tray, even if it seems like the majority of customers at least during the time i visited were sitting down in the restaurant. the box was greasy, but the chicken sandwich was great. the waffle fries were pretty good, but the cheese roll was also greasy and felt like a random accompaniment with the sandwich. the lemonade was good, but the large is not that big? and it was a little weird that the drink prices they advertised were only for the small sizes and i really had no way of knowing how much more the large size would be. my meal came to  17, which is not the worst, but i dont know if it was worth that much. i would definitely get the sandwich again, but maybe on its own, rather than the meal."
Suculento Restaurante,5,good to stop in before a game at fenway!
Five Horses Tavern - South End,4,three and a half stars fish sandwich was good the two junior roast beefs were extremely gray and dried out if it wasnt for the sauce you wouldnt have been able to eat them overcooked roast beef big time

Chef Chang's,4,i will try this place again just to see if they can get better. location and view is great. the decor was modern and fresh. wifi is unheard of fast.the waitress was slow to address us initially and apologized. however it never got better. the appetizer arrived in record fast time. however it was delivered by someone other than our waitress and she never checked on the the appetizer or if we need anything.between the appetizer and the meal she never returned and the food took forever almost 30 minutes. again a third staff member brought our food and never checked if we needed anything so we still had to wait for refills.the buffalo cauliflower bits were different. i never had them before and i heard they are all the craze. they were good but the entire point of buffalo wings is the crunch so it did not to it for me.i had the smoked chicken mac and cheese. very cheesy and creamy but the chicken was a waste of the additional money. i could not taste any smoke and the portion of chicken was small. i hated that the they used tiny spiral noodles that were undercooked.hubby had the bayou chicken pasta. it was not at all spicy and they had two peppers that were sauteed and not cut. the waitress said the peppers were generally sliced width wise and were raw. she offered for us to get something else but we had waited long enough for that meal.   she did bring over sliced pepper which helped with the flavor.

Penang Malaysian Cuisine,5,the foods not bad however we had a strange interaction. we asked if it was possible to get half feta and half taziki. they said that it was an extra 0.75 which was fine. we got it to go. walking out the door we saw no taziki so we turn around and asked if we could could get the taziki. they staff had a quick back and forth. they then proceeded to scoop out half of the feta which had been touching the meat and put i back into the main feta supply. this just seems unsaintairy and would be dishonest to those with specific dietary requirements. foods okay but some of the places practices we question.
Chilacates Mission Hill,5,"best filet i have had. pair it with 50 acres red wine. and finish it off with bread pudding and black coffee. our waitress michelle was phenomenal, kind, efficient. prefer seating on upper level which has high ceilings rather than lower level."

Coppa Enoteca,5,"this location is okay. i wont blame the restaurant for what goes on around it, even though it does affect the experience. the restaurant itself is alright as the food is usually good, but service can sometimes be extremely slow, and staff will sometimes give you contradicting instructions for pickup between visits."

Starbucks,4,ceviche was delicious. the other food was nothing to write home about. just average. not authentic peruvian food i believe the cook is from a  neighboring south american country server was not very attentive. we had to ask for utensils and water  we were rushed out as soon as we finished eating as the facility is small and people were waiting to be seated. all is all not the worst dinning experience but definitely not good.

Doña Habana Restaurant,5,"masa has gone downhill since we last went in the spring. the tapas sampler went from 10 to 20 and were tasty, if a touch greasy.  the famous cornbread for 5 was three cubes of very good cornbread, buttered and grilled, served with honey molasses butter. again, tasty, but heavy on the fat and a bit overpriced.  service was good."

Il Molo,5,good service and good basic food
Expresso Pizza,5,"great little place for a bit of live music and dinner. most of us got the chicken i chose dark meat and waffles which we all enjoyed, but also all thought there could have been a little more chicken. the waffles were nice and fluffy. the chicken was fried perfectly. moist and flavorful with a great crispy crust. getting it with strips seemed to yield a slightly more generous portion of chicken. also tried the collard greens which were also delicious and the mashed potatoes which were alright. but i came to this place for soul food. something that brings you back to the moment in time your life when you had your first forkspoonful of your absolute favorite dish. and while i may not have gotten quite there, this place definitely have it a damn good try. i definitely recommend this place and i look forward to my next meat there.on a nonfood related note, there is a cover charge per person automatically added onto the check for the live entertainment. this is clearly listed on their website, though, but still worth mentioning in case you dont spend a few moments surfing their homepage."
Denny's,5,"am i the only one who failed to understand the prestige associated with this place? ordered 3 slices of crepe cake and two cups of coffee for a total about 50. the crepe cake was not bad, it tasted just like how it looked  layers of overly soft soggy crepe stacked together. flavor was just average or even slightly below. the coffee was definitely below. still, the store traffic was amazing."

TGI Fridays,3,"decent food, prices and very late hours. however, expect extremely noisy and poor seating during typical dinner time. other reviews talk of getting orders mixed up, and both my trips also had mix ups with the staff. if youre ok not being able to chat while eating and having to double check your orders, this could be a great spot for you"
753 South,5,"salad bar has a great blend, and the young ladies that prepare them are absolute darlings!"
KT Grill,5,"was mainly here for the soup dumplings which were okay. it could be better but it helps soothe the craving for soup dumplings.1 fried duck dumplings 4  letter c13 on the menu. lots of dough and a bit oily on the outside. but has decent amount of stuffing inside. it was good but probably wouldnt get it again.2 steamed beef soup dumpings 6  letter c11 on the menu. dough was a bit thick when it should be thinner but soup was hot and meat was juicy and tender.3 steamed beef  crab soup dumplings 6  letter c12 on menu. the addition of crab was interesting but probably wouldnt get it again. again, the dough was too thick and the orange crab meat on top of the dumpling was weird."

75 on Liberty Wharf,4,"huge bar, only 1 bartender..."
Tasty Burger,5,excellent brunch followed by good cocktails and beer for a rainy sunday afternoon. excellent service shame restroom capacity is small compared against number of seats and the restrooms at the marriott opersite are grim.
El jardín Restaurant & Bakery,5,"food was good, but not anything great. the real draw here is the rock memorabilia, ranging from aerosmith guitars to a letter written by paul mccartney. despite all of the great memorabilia, the service was pretty mediocre. we went on a thursday night around 8 pm, and our waitress kept complaining how she had no time and how she had to work a double and how she couldnt give us much attention since she was so busy. overall, a cool place to go if you are into rock memorabilia, but otherwise a pretty average place to eat."
Cafe Jaffa,3,great food!  the calamari appetizer was fantastic. the sauce on the spaghetti and meatballs was very flavorful. the manicotti...sigh...i miss it....

Lilly's Gourmet Pasta Express,3,i must say this is some pretty good indian food! sure there is some better indian restaurants in the city but theyve managed to incorporate authentic indian cuisine with authentic spices to the point were an average american could eat the entrees. the flavors nice the meat and vegetarian entrees are good. and the price to portion ratio is on point this is a great place for take out and for lunch i recommend if you like indian cuisine
QDOBA Mexican Eats,5,"finally made it here, and was very glad to discover that the portions arent pretentiously small and the food was really quite good. the cheese plate included like 10 ounces of cheese. getting the tzatziki was a very wise decision. as was ordering the beer cocktailshandy drink item, the name of which escapes me. will definitely be back for dinner and or drinks one night."
Fill-A-Buster Luncheonette,5,america and i run on dunkins
Venezia Restaurant Boston,5,"four stars for the food. especially half portion pastas. definitely go great with the bread and other menu items.unfortunately, its very loud inside since there are brick walls and open ceilings. the noise cant go anywhere, so its not the most pleasant place to try to have a conversation.wait staff was friendly and otherwise it was a good restaurant."

Uptowne Mediterranean Restaurant,5,this mcdonalds is incredibly disorganized. ive actually never waited 15 minutes for anything at any mcdonalds until tonight. seems like the installation of the automated kiosks and the web appgrubhub orders have lended to the chaos. i feel bad for the employees.

KFC,4,legendary
Soul of India,5,"review below was updated based upon my most recent visit.fantastically rude hostess, i called ahead for a table and was assured i had one waiting.  when i walked in with two children they suddenly had no table and refused to seat me and my two little ones.  when i pushed back i was told nothing is guaranteed and that i would have to wait 30 to 45 minutes.if there had been an extenuating circumstance i could have understood as i have worked as a waiter and the front of the room.  but the hostess was rude and dismissive.  as a small business owner i can tell you it is hard to find good help, but this sort of behavior from a neighborhood place was offensive.  this was one of my go to places, but will never be going back."
El Paso Enchiladas,5,"this place really stuck out for me. it was not what youd expect the fenway area to offer but the service was still awesome and the drinks potent! i grabbed a 3 bag of house made beef jerk this was after 1 am, after all! and it was completely worth it. i can see this place being a regular hangout for me, at least when i find myself over in the neighborhood. also, kudos to whoever was in charge of music when i went last thursdayfriday night!"

HAJU Kitchen,5,"best chinese food in a 20 mile radius. they have both authentic and americanized. some must haves are the dan  dan noodles, the beef with pepper and onions, the basil fish, and the green beans. its a tiny little hole in the wall, but do yourself a favor and stop here for lunch or dinner. not while im here though. more for me!"
Our House East,5,"great good, great service"
Bullfinchs,3,had good food
Ostra,3,"the wife, a friend of ours and i had lunch at pastoral earlier today. we arrived just past one and walked into what was a fairly busy restaurant which was about 6070 full and were promptly seated. we were hungry and looked forward to our meal there.the wife has celiac and was happy to see that they had glutenfree crusts available at a 2 surcharge which we happily went for. she ordered a glutenfree, pepperoni pizza 17, our friend got the blance one 16 and i went with their proscuitto one 18. we also ordered a few beers and a cocktail for the wife.service was painfully slow. we waited at least 15 minutes for our drink orders to be placed and at least another 1015 for our drinks to finally arrive. luckily, by that point, our pizzas were nearly ready and arrived a few instants later.the pizzas, glutenfree and regular, were all pretty tasty and we didnt have any soggy or burnt issues that other reviews have mentioned.  however, at least in my case, the prosciutto was just three small pieces and while it was pretty good, it definitely wasnt even close to being worth 18. maybe 14 on a good day, and especially for a socalled lunch menu.our bill for the three, single sized pizzas, the two beers and the cocktail topped 85 which is pretty damn pricey for lunch. had this been the best naplesstyle pizza in town, then maybe that would have been okay but they have nothing on posto somerville or gran gusto cambridge and again, like i said, this was the lunch hour were people want a quick, cheap and small meal, which definitely wasnt.on the upside the decor is neat and the craft beer selection and cocktails pretty solid. plus its in fort point which is another plus, especially on a nice day like today where the windows were opened. if they were able to bring the prices down and improve the service, id totally give them another shot."
Vito's Tavern,4,"food and service are excellent! make a reservation, though."
Applebee's Grill + Bar,5,"ive lived in the middle east so i have a pretty good idea of what authentic mediterranean food looks and tastes like. that said, garlic n lemons is a place i can recommend for its wide selection of yummy food. i would recommend the chicken shwarma on greek salad plate, large portions at a fair price..especially for the area. you will enjoy for sure"

Boston Burger Company,5,"one of my favorite spots in boston.  definitely make it a priority to hang out downstairs vs. upstairs.  its a beautiful space with a large bar, and a great view of the stage.  versatile spot that is great for a dinner out for 26 people with decent drinks and surprisingly solid menu."

Warehouse Bar & Grille,5,"went for the 1 maki happy hour in the bar area, since it seemed like a deal that was too good to be true. it seems it was i couldnt tell the difference between the salmon, tuna, and yellowtail maki, and the female staff were dressed in a uniform akin to a corset. i understand now that the venue becomes something akin to a club in the evening, but the uniform during the day made me uncomfortable."

Lucia Ristorante,4,everything was delicious. service was awesome.
Cósmica,5,great staff. great bar. could use some retraining on sanitary procedures. i.e dont touch a dirty rag or rubbish on the floor and then start preparing my drinks. we had to ask the bartender 2x to wash his hands before serving our drinks. he went willingly but we should not have had to ask. otherwise great atmosphere!
North End Fish & Sushi,4,good food
Viva Burrito,5,"excellent fast and friendly service. i cant wait to try other places, but this place might serve up the most flavorful tacos in all of boston. theyre priced right too.very pleased with the tacos and a side order of fresh pineapple that i had. pardon me for praising the bear minimum effort here, but the pineapple was actually ripe. sweet. delicious. other places sometimes have their fruit sides unripened and flavorless. thats a plus.my biggest disappointments are1 the duck quessadilla. delicious, but tiny. way too tiny. 7 wasted. maybe ill get it again another time when i care less about blowing 7, because it really did taste good. maybe thats how other menu options are too. i guess ill find out next time i come because this place does warrant a return visit. i came for the tacos and im glad i did, but kept my eye on the menu and got carried away and tried other things.2 what kind of mexican placetaco bar doesnt serve horchata? they have no horchata on the menu.at the end of it all, the staff and food are great. the restaurant has a beautifully decorated interior, the location is very nice, tucked away in a cozy corner within historic fort point in the seaport district. i imagine its even nicer in the summer time with outdoor seating options. i was just here at 1115am on a weekday in the middle of winter. i left right as it seemed to start to get really busy for lunch.lastly, parking options arent the best. thats not their fault though. theres plenty of street parking but on other streets. and some nearby lots.i will return."

"Explorateur Cafe, Restaurant & Bar",5,"quite possibly the best italian food i have ever had. started off with the bruschetta, which was borderline decadent.  i followed this up with the linguine alla pescatore which was heavenly. most places would give you two or three shrimp and a few scallops this dish was loaded down with shrimp, muscles, clams, scallops and calamari. every bite had something in it besides the pasta. i highly recommend getting it with the frame diavolo sauce. service was quick and professional."
Sullivan's Castle Island,5,"this small place has delicious lobster rolls and best clam chowder i have had by far in boston. fried oysters was good as well. prices are at average for this area. nice and friendly service. i would recommend everyone to come here. our friends are local, and they said this place is one best option."

Victoria Seafood,3,gaga seafood has great food!  everything cooked right and authentic.
Crudo,4,"nice swanky place. a bit on the pricey side. the one thing that irked me a bit and explains the decrease for the star is that they have a rule that you cannot sit at a table without your whole party and without ordering a full dinner. i absolutely understand that for friday and saturday, even thursday. but i went on a wednesday right at 430 and it was empty minus the couple people at the bar.we were ordering dinner so we did end up getting a table. service was nice and attentive. they brought a grapefruit slush and splashed it with their tequila. food was good i recommend the corn. at the end, they brought a fluffy cotton candy sprinkled with pop rocks which was a cute touch."

Pizza Mia Bar & Grill,5,better than mcdonalds lol
Santouka Back Bay,5,very nice everyone treated me very politely.
Joy Asia,5,"i love the vibe of this place. most bu campus restaurants skimp on service and quality simply because its catered to college students.they completely transformed the old restaurant and created a trendy, nyc modern asian fusion vibe.i got the double awesome with pastrami, and there were so many flavors. the scallion pancake wasnt too oily and the pesto and eggs added a great touch to the entire sandwich. its a unique sandwich you wont be able to find anywhere else!their bathrooms are so clean, they smell good and have cute decor. that says a lot since usually bathrooms suck around the area."

Pavement Coffeehouse,3,"service was 1010! jordan l. a fantastic server  friendly, attentive, and gave great recommendations!feta and brussels sprouts were the star of the show for me and i highly recommend both they were fantastic! i also really enjoyed the ryewallah cocktail for dessert!cocktails were creative but a little expensive. again i cannot recommend the feta and brussels enough. we werent huge fans of the manti and i think i would choose a different seafood dish next time. the lamb slouvaki was good but a little too well done for my liking. the short rib was not what i expected because it was like a casserole and very hearty but the short rib flavor was great.i would definitely come back for more!"
Mei Mei,5,fancy restaurant
IHOP,5,best lunch option for healthconscious and vegetarianvegan patrons.
HAJU Kitchen,5,"hostess was friendly, and the inside is clean and inviting, but our table for two was tiny, and there was a very rowdy group at the bar who were swearing and yelling loudly, and were allowed to carry on, seemingly without being asked to keep it down.  service was slow, and our waitperson fairly unattentive took too long to catch her attention for drinks, check, etc.  food was cooked appropriately, but just bland and unexciting, especially for the prices.   my daughter  had enjoyed her last visit here, so i was definitely hoping for better, but was disappointed."

Moko Japanese Cuisine,4,the food was incredible and the service was immaculate.
Capo Restaurant & Supper Club,4,i been here couple times and still continue to come here. i am only giving it 4 stars out of 5 because a few reasons. i really love the cheap buffalo wings they provide you when you sit in the bar during certain time. of course you have to order a drink before you can start getting those 25 cents per wing. i only reason i dont like going there is because floor would feel sticky but it is a bar! i know i know but i still need to follow my review standards. the service is great and one of the best. we received a lot of attention from the staff. like i said i am willing to come again.
Florentine Cafe,4,"very accommodating folks, great boston night time hangout."
Papa's Pizza Company,4,"i love boston market for quick,  homestyle cooking and healthy choices.  the dorchester location is always stocked full to the brim with good, freshly cooked food  but quincy sometimes run out of things and you have to wait  or its simply not available.  either location, it is always great food!"

Tikkaway Grill,4,"wow.. really really must visit place. wanted to go to a well known place to try the waygu steak for the first time and this place blew it out of the park. we had a party  of 6 and absolutely no one went away upset. the place is very very awesome. i had to try the waygu a5 prefecture japan steak.....it was only 2oz for 52 but so so so worth the experience .... i have never in my entire life tastes a steak as tender and delicious as this. it literally melted away in my mouth like butter. and that was just the start of the unbelievable feast we had.  i also had the shellfish sampler which was amazing and had lobster tails, oysters , shrimp, and this fantastic crab salad. then we had the soft shell crab special....delicious. and the crudo which was fantastic as well... then for my main i had the american kobe cap steak with blue cheese crust and on the side i asked for it on the side instead of on top i had king crab oscar and asparagus... omg ...it was so good. delicious... super tender and cooked to perfection. the sides with it were outstanding .....the japanese sweet potatoes were seriously the best sweet potatoes i have ever tasted..and then the mushrooms were great as well. drinks were great ...and their drink menu is ridiculous. we ended the night with desserts that were really delicious. the coconut cake came with homemade pineapple and other fruit ice cream that was some of the best ice cream i have ever had.....the creme brulee was great as well...and the chocolate cookies were out of this world. it was a very expensive night but well worth it. service was really good and we will definitely be back for another visit. i seriously want people to know that the waygu steak a5 will literally be the best steak you have ever tasted in your entire life. guaranteed. a must visit. you will spend a lot of money but what you taste for it is worth it. great great place. well done. picture i posted of the kobe steak doesnt do it justice. it was amazing.buddhareview"

Boston fried chicken,4,"went for brunch. great food. they forgot 2 of 6 orders due to being duplicates, but they were very apologetic and made sure to make it up to us in order to keep it a great experience. french toast is a solid option for the sweet tooth while the breakfast sandwich is great for the more savory option. if youre order doesnt come with potatoes, order a side of them. crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. and salty."
Sapore Ristorante & Bar,5,we attempted to eat here two days in a row and each time the wait was more than 2 hours. no breakfast place is that good or worth that long a wait. for sure not a friendly toast

The Pour House,5,i was excited to try this place after reading so many good reviews. i ordered a boumdia flat and was sadly disappointed when i saw it. they gave me rotten avocados which i end picking out before taking a bite. the eggs in the sandwich did not taste like it was made to order esp for the price i was paying for. i probably wont be going back here again.

Fogo de Chão Brazilian Steakhouse,4,"may, 2020 pickup of appordered food. all correct  no contact visit."
Sweet Life,5,probably one of the best chinese food places in chinatown in boston. thats not saying much because chinese food in boston in general is subpar but at least this place is quite tasty. the seafood is fresh and the dim sum during weekends are especially good.
Abe & Louie's,5,"the food was good. the wings were very tasty. the pizza was okay. we didnt eat the gyro because we got really full from the other pizza and the wings.however, our server ignored us to the point of being rude. she gave us our waters, took our order, and didnt ask us what sides we want. i especially called her later to tell her which sides i want. during our meal, she didnt ask us one if the food was okay or not. i had to call her again after sitting for a long time to ask for the check and to go boxes. she seemed upset that we wanted the to go boxes.all those people who are wondering how busy the restaurant was that she didnt bother to smile at us once, it was okay busy. it was not bursting with people but it wasnt empty either. when we were leaving, 1 couple was waiting to be seated which is not terribly busy considering a saturday night."
Arya Trattoria,4,"this place is kind of weird. you enter through the bar in the establishment next door. you then walk through usually kind of empty bar to a door that connects to 6b which has booths and is crowded. there is a 5 cover, depending on music can be okay. if you are looking for a place to dance, then this is tough because its too crowded and narrow of a space with no dance floor, the bar is in the back and can be hard to get to but if you get a booth they have waitresses that can bring you drinks. if you are looking to chill then this place is too loud and packed for that. its a toss up."
Fin Point Oyster Bar + Grille,5,no poke bowls on the weekend  but good food. some of it is a little pricey. decent service.
Buttermilk & Bourbon,4,"attended for a company event on a mid saturday afternoon.  evocative physical setting which was belied by events.  surly waitress with attitude.  mass confusion on the part of servers.  the food gave both my wife and i a nice case of 36hour indigestion.  great selection of beer though.  for a more satisfying experience, try doyles instead but not on st. pats day!."
Kings Dining & Entertainment,4,"amazing food, no waiting, friendly and welcoming. my wife and i would come again for another bite in the future."

RUKA,5,"welcome to the world of ricotta, mozzarella, tomato sauce and various pasta! both the food and the service are impressive at this place, located in bostons italian district. the waiters appear to be of italian origin and speak with cute italian accent, which contributes a lot to the unique atmosphere.the food is prepared quickly. i can heartily recommend the mums meatballs with ricotta. in general, the food is light on fats and as long as you dont overeat, you will feel pretty fine.the desserts are not listed in the menu, but the smiling suntanned italian lady will be happy to describe whats on offer. she will also be very happy if you leave completely empty plates after you for lunch you maybe lucky to find an available table, but for dinner make a reservation."
Sbarro,5,this location specifically does a really nice job. i like chiplote in general but this is the best location i have been to.
Ashmont Grill,3,"it used to be good, but the quality especially in there pizza has gone down significantly"

Stephi's in Southie,3,"they have very good, thin gluten free crust. they let you completely customize how they make your pizza. additionally the service is top notch."
Darbar,5,"good value, fast free delivery versus the local dominos which charges 3 for delivery.  nice late hours in a neighborhood where most businesses close early, 10 online ordering discount is a nice plus.pizza is good, especially the polo gourmet  californian, but their replacement of pesto sauce in various gourmet pizzas with a heavy cream sauce continues to be a culinary tragedy. skip the jalapeno poppers, they are bland and the artificial bright orange cheese filling is gross."
Luna's Italian & Latin Cuisine Restaurant,5,translated by google very good food but very slow and should think about expanding the placeoriginalmuy buena la comida pero muy lenta y deberan de pensar en ampliar el lugar

Shojo,5,dirty they dont clean the table. bad coffee. staff unfriendly. worst dunkin donuts i been through
Oisa Ramen,5,"the waitress was excellent. but the food was tasteless. and i travel a lot around the country just to eat at mom and pops restaurants. a pinch of salt is good before is the food is cooked, otherwise the customer have to put half a salt shaker bottle to compensate for the lack of taste."
The Harp,4,"though it has the location and the celebrity chef, everytime ive come here i was disappointed in the bbq. mind you the sides were all really good. save your money, there are better bbq places in the city."
Earls Kitchen + Bar,5,"hands down best service ever. waitress and waiters and manager are super professional, nice, warm. they immediately fix issues when it arises. we went here for a birthday and they made it perfect with a dessert and everything else, like a card, etc etc. steak was juicy, sauces great. better than abe and louies and a mile above del friscos downstairs on the other end of the mall. kids meals were huge and tastes amazing....i had a few bites of their mac and cheese and enormous salad and druid and huge mango sorbet which was made from fresh mangoes. my kids usually hate kids meals since they have a fine palate but they loved it here."

Lucca Restaurant,5,"reasonable prices for large portions, especially sandwiches and pastas"
Pavia Catering,5,"staff is patient and respectful.the food was... ok. in the world of 15 meals burger, shake, fries i would put this near the bottom. the basic burger mooyah burger is the same as a local pizza place burger. they say the shake is 100 ice cream but i doubt that. it tastes like a standard fast food machine ice creamfroyo, its also half the size of a mcdonalds shake and probably twice as much. the fries are ok, i personally just dont like the seasoning on it.it was fine for a one time experience."
Applebee's Grill + Bar,4,"came here after a bu game. this place serves real chicken in their chicken strips, none of this processed chickenmeatpaste. it can get quite busy after a game as its just across the street from the rink. all part of the bu experience though."

Crush Pizza,1,delicious pho! best around!
The Local Wayland,4,excellent.... very highend luxury real friendly and attentive. you think youre in a vegas restaurant

Limoncello,5,excellent food and quick
Papa's Pizza Company,4,"perfect location for date night or drinks with friends! they have great cocktails and a fun lively atmosphere with live jazz music. the food is good hearty comfort food. i went recently on a date night with my husband and it didnt disappoint  the truffled potato  cheese pierogies were delicious and melt in your mouth. for entrees, my husband had the lamb and chicken moroccan couscous and i had the short rib grilled cheese, both very good.  it can get very crowded by the bar on weekends so if youre eating id try to get a table closer to the stage."
Olive Garden,4,"great vegetarian burgers and the fries were perfect. its smack in the heart of copley square, boston at the back bay train station."
Papagayo,4,"great food, i got the chicken pesto flatbread and an espresso martini. place was packed on a thursday night. good spot to stop in before a show at the opera house."
wagamama,5,its a popular place so i expected to wait and had no problem with that. a party before me was called and they werent there and they moved on. simple. at most places if a party missed their name being called and come back they go to the end of line. the hostess moves on.  i was next and the party comr back and hostess gives them the next table. not the end of the world but frusterating. it was finally my turn and the hostess asked where the rest of my party was. i said they are two minutes away. the hostess asked if i wanted to be seated or if she could seat someone else. i politley said i would like to be seated and my other half was close. she then said she would sit another party and didntdilisten to me. if it wasnt an option then why would she even ask. unprofessional.
Boston Burger Company,5,lots of beer and whiskey!  with customizable flights you can try array of flavors!
Jook Sing Cafe,1,this place was great  the sushi is really top notch. service was attentive and i would come back here again and again. getting a table was no problem because it was nearly empty but that will change as more people discover it.
Friendly's,5,"burnt burger,  had less then dozen fries"
Back Bay Social,4,"the decor was very inviting and fun. very friendly and respectful host as well. i had the arepas de pernil, but they were really plain. should have ordered the empanadas i guess... also, their squeezed juice servings are puny."

Saloniki Greek,5,good food and fast service. open early and late
PikaloX,4,"fantastic bar, cant personally speak for the food yet, as the only thing ive had there was drinks and the baked alaska which i would have recommend. ambiance is very enjoyable, and conducive to having a nice conversation with whoever you went with, or whoever you might meet."
Sullivan's Castle Island,5,honestly the food was great i love it but the service was awful..the counter clerk was very rude and im not sure cause i was black they def look over me standing there and attend to the hispanic customers and the white lady that was in there at the time..it wasnt until i complain the gentleman came and fix my food..he apologize but they was speaking spanish about me ..again we as minorities need to stick together not divided and as much as i love the food..bad service is a no no for me..
Gaslight,5,its tr.
The Paramount,5,"the price is steep, and some people will complain about that, but the amount of food you get for that price is insane. it just never stops, and the quality is right up there, its amazing. i enjoyed this restaurant and i would come back often if i could. you can sign up for their emailing list and get nice coupons though which definitely helps"
Sudbury Pizza Place,1,translated by google comidagood food ..originalbuena comida..

P & R Restaurant,4,"fun menu, creative cocktails, great staff. you better go....."
Morton's The Steakhouse,5,pretty poor experience here.  a lot of staff behind the counter for pretty slow service.  many of the sodas and the raspberry lemonade were out of syrup.

Harborside Grill and Patio,5,very friendly staff!

Chuck E. Cheese,5,"wonderful experience, extremely friendly staff did a good job managing the ebb and flow of customers. the meal was great, and they even took back and warmed up my partners plate after she had to step out. on that topic, be aware that there is no public restroom here. the closest is at the old north church, and its foul. best to arrive here empty, so to speak. but that doesnt take away from what a nice lunch spot this is!"

Black Seed Cafe & Grill,5,"i got a great service from the beautiful setting. the menu choices were great, and the food was delicious."
Great Taste,5,doesnt  get any better for carnivores! salad bar superb.
Villa Mexico Cafe,4,"the food here is spectacular and the staff was friendly and accommodating. our food was prepared and delivered quickly, and everything tasted great. my only negative comment is that this place feels very claustrophobic. youre almost touching every person sitting near you, and theres only space for one person to walk each walkway. otherwise great place"

anoush'ella,5,amazing tapas
Chicken Lou's Inc,5,"my friend and i went here last night and it was horrible. the sushi didnt take fresh, one waiter keep avoiding us the whole time. it was a very unpleasant experience. the place next door was way better i think it called the 4 or something. never coming back."

My Thai Vegan Cafe,3,while the restaurant is easily spotted from the main road parking in the area is not easy. if you are going to visit this restaurant you must be prepared to park in a garage of one of the buildings near by. the interior layout of the restaurant isnt very big but it aesthetically pleasing. the stair up to the restaurant are very steep so if you have a problem with walk or your knees i highly suggest the elevator to your left soon as you walk through the revolving door. since covid much has changed. now you are only allowed 90 minutes per seating and all parties must be present before you are seated. i recommend arriving 510 minutes early to check in and give the staff time to prepare your table. some of the staff are better than others lucky for us natalie was wonderful she was very attentive and checked on us at the right amount of times without being overbearing. her recommendations were spot on and we had a lovely time.

Blaze Pizza,4,"overpriced for the quality of food they serve. their dishes lack authenticity to any part of chinese cuisine. their supposed mala bang consists of a mishmash of ingredients in what only can be conceived as poorly picked store bought flavoring packets. the fish flavored eggplant is so sour that no other flavors can be appreciated. as a native of  sichuan, i can say that this place does not serve anything authentic in that sichuan cuisine. the other dishes are just typical chinese fair that is exorbitantly priced. a plate of site fried green beans is 10. if you want authentic chinese food from a varying regions of china, just walk a couple of feet over to gourmet dumpling house."

Crispy Dough Pizzeria,4,"i am currently sitting in line at the drive through, and i have enough time to write a review for every restaurant in norwood. honestly i have been here multiple times since it opened, and every time i think that there is no way the wait could be as bad as the last time. it is. im talking consistent 20 minute wait times for drive through. the food has always been pretty good, which is why it gets two stars."

Boston Chops South End,4,"the bebop opened recently to replace the old pad thai cafe that used to be here as part of a strip of lower priced restaurants serving a predominantly college aged crowd. the facelift was necessary, adapting and utilizing the space in an efficient manner. the theme plays into jazz and old music. this includes records and instruments adorning the walls with a subtle and maybe not so subtle irish overtone.this establishment doesnt have a full liquor license,  so you can get a guinness or flavored martini, but no jameson on the rocks or a classic vodka soda. drink prices seem nominal and on par for the area. food here is reminiscent of classic irish dishes and local seafood favorites. the shepards pie was fantastic and a staple dish of such a restaurant. on the contrary, the oysters were pricey and were served with a strange ketchup heavy cocktail sauce that made the sea creatures far too sweet for my blood.the service is good here, but that doesnt really seem to be the point. food is a pretty general breakdown of bar and local favorites. the idea here, to me, is to serve as an ablebodied meeting point, complimentary with live music and a comfortable vibe."
Palate Restaurant Latin Inspired Cuisine & Bar,5,best breakfast sandwiches in town. great coffee too. better to order ahead because of the long line that forms in brunch time

New Golden Gate Seafood,4,"honestly love this place so much! there is always a line so we try to go there a little bit before opening or else its at least a thirty minute wait. love the noodles and variety of fish balls, etc. the price is really good and even if you want to buy meatseafood, its only 46 more! also like the fact that you dont have to share a pot. only complaint is that the broth is a bit bland, but the sauce bar makes up for the lack of flavor! my favorite part is the green tea soft serve!! i always get two cones.."
