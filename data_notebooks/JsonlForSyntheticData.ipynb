Honestly nothing but rave reviews to give and highly recommend if you like to eat! lol We started off with the combo plate which features a potato knish, cheese blintz with fresh berries, potato latke over apple sauce and kugal.  We also got a pickle plate (best pickles everrrrrr).  2 cups of matzo ball soup to start.  One of my sons got the banana stuffed French toast with bourbon cream filling, other son got an omelette with corned beef hash swiss cheese and English muffins and home fries, my husband got a 50/50 corned beef pastrami with swiss on rye and I had a pastrami on marble.  It was a feast! The service was impeccable,  coffee was delicious and the food was on point.  There was easily 30 people waiting outside and we waited an hour to be seated but....it was worth it!

Happily, I can report everything was excellent -- the cocktails were innovative and sweet without being cloying, the food was delicious as usual with generous portions, and the service was kind and attentive.\\n\\nWe came here at 5pm on a Tuesday and the bar was already full up. We started with the aperol/grapefruit/macadamia creme cocktail and the broken Spanish -- both were excellent, bursting with tropical flavors but tempered with creamy elements. We also started with the ox tail/tripe appetizer, which was perfectly prepared in the Sichuan fashion, with lots of chili oil, peanuts, and cilantro.\\n\\nFor dinner, we ordered the wen jun fish and the tofu skin crepes stuffed with mushrooms. Both were excellent; while the tofu skin crepes were a little on the sweet side, they were stuffed to the brim with mushrooms, so no complaints there. The fish was lovely as well. The kitchen also accidentally sent out a mapo tofu (which they comped) -- it was surprisingly tasty, with the hot pepper and meat flavors really penetrating the soft tofu.\\n\\nMy partner ordered a second cocktail -- the bocadillo sour -- which she also enjoyed a lot.

They’re the best cold, rainy weather treat on a Friday after a tough week. The Impossible Burger Pizza is as remarkable as the hype suggests by locals on social media! I noticed, though, that even when asking for extra vegan cheese, the pizzas still contain very, very little cheese. I wonder if that’s just the style of their chefs?\\n\\nThe staff here are great. The woman who answers the phone is always so friendly and upbeat and accommodating. The team that runs your card to pay when you go to pick up are always friendly even when orders are coming in like crazy and there’s no end in sight. Our orders have always been ready by the time we arrive 25 minutes later.\\n\\nIn hindsight, I’ve become quite upset that in all of our orders — which are requested to be completely vegan — they include a mini Rice Krispy-esque treat in the bag. This treat is not vegan, which their social media account informed me. I had to inquire on Instagram, and was told it was a mistake, one which happened over and over and over again to us. So unfortunately, you still must be vigilant as a vegan and inquire if every aspect of your meal is indeed vegan.'}\n",

One of my sons got the banana stuffed French toast with bourbon cream filling, other son got an omelette with corned beef hash swiss cheese and English muffins and home fries, my husband got a 50/50 corned beef pastrami with swiss on rye and I had a pastrami on marble.

So you debate about whether to get something sweet or something savory, and it\\'s like \"Hurry up the girl at the counter is getting annoyed at your indecisiveness.\" She wasn\\'t getting annoyed, but if she was she hid it quite well. So we get our crepes and wow a table opened up so let\\'s just hang out here and also get coffee. So we get coffee and eat our crepes and we hang out a bit and make fun about how overly French this whole place is. It\\'s not like real French like Petit Louie back home, it\\'s the type of Parisian French that\\'s kinda kitschy but I suppose would be charming if I wasn\\'t a cynical human being. The crepes were pretty good, didn\\'t blow my mind like this one place in NYC, but totally enjoyable in the moment. Also a chill atmosphere if you don\\'t mind being crammed in tight spaces with a bunch of people and are okay with feeling like you are perpetually in the way of someone. But yeah, totally, it is a place to get crepes if you\\'re stuck in Brookline.'}\n",

Tea was good, they can make you ceremonial style green tea. Desserts looked good and tempting but when my wife and I tried it, there was something off with the flavor that didn't hit the mark. Funny we added some of the ceremonial green tea and it was loads better.\\nThe place itself was very nice, clean and I could see myself staying here to work over a Starbucks. The music was live and beautiful. The food from the restaurant looked good but we ate just prior at a lovely Japanese place around the corner.\\nSo purely as a cafe it is has a very nice atmosphere, but unfortunately it's a bit expensive and food was okay.\"}\n",

Walking out, I just had to snag some of the Intense black tea blend once seeing that they offer it in loose leaf (tea bags available as well). Definitely a new favorite.\"}\n",
