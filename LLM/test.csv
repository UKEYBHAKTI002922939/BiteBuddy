Oliveira's Steak House,3,"Decent Brazilian Steakhouse. Plenty of staff at the restaurant and they are all very friendly. However, all of their meats are oversalted. I'm not sure what the issue is, but the flavor profile for all of the steaks tasted the same. The salt really overkilled everything. I will admit that several of the cuts were tender and rather juicy. I really wish I could give a higher review, only if they could tone down their salt levels.","['Brazilian Steakhouse', 0.5]",Brazilian Steakhouse,0.5,4,Brazilian Steakhouse

The salad and sides buffet is really nice (don't miss the creamy beef stroganoff).
